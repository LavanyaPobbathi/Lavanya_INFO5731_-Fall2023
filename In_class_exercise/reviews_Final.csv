"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).Grade: A.","i have trouble turning off my brain.

"If you take drugs for the first time and imagined Jackie Chan was a female Dr. Strange in another universe this would be it. And the synopsis is basically an Asian woman trying to do her taxes. I thought the third act of the movie felt a little stretched out but otherwise I think it's the best movie I've seen all year because I haven't laughed this much in any recent one. From the short time I spent in China, it's also an accurate and hilarious view of Chinese parents 'cause they really do be like that. I can't recommend it enough, it's so chaotic and in the middle of all that managed to be heartfelt too. I thought it was gonna be a Dr Strange wannabe but it's unique on it's own and I'm glad it was released earlier so that people don't compare them. It was just four people (strangers) in the cinema, we were laughing our asses off and it made me sad because everyone deserves to see this. At a time when remakes and reboots are common place it's nice to have something like this, a breath of fresh air.","if you take drugs for the first time and imagined jackie chan was a female dr.

"""Be kind, especially when you don't know what's going on.""If only we could recognize that those who combat us in life do so out of hidden pain, and fight them with kindness. If only we could accept our kids for who they are, and say supportive things from the heart instead of trying to mold them. If only we could be content with the life we have, and set aside the idea of the countless other lives we might have led, had we made different decisions along the way. If only we could see that the flipside to life being meaningless and everything ultimately being sucked into the abyss is the freedom that comes from that, that we can do anything with the time we've got.Like the first word in its title, this film feels like everything. While watching it I thought Stephanie Hsu was everything too, but then again, so was Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis. The homage to Wong Kar-Wai with Ke Huy Quan making his enlightened speech is extraordinary, and the fact that James Hong was still getting it done at age 93 was wonderful. I also loved how both mother and daughter, troubled as they were with their upbringing, each found comfort in a kind and patient partner, and Tallie Medel's character was a nice touch.The film threatens to go off the rails with its madcap multiverse hopping in the first part, but it's all a setup for the second part, which is incredibly powerful. It was impressive that it managed to be so entertaining along the way, with its fast-paced action and the wild ride it takes us on. It's one that rewards a rewatch to, as its full of little details and references. Just a great film, lots of fun, and from the heart.","""be kind, especially when you don't know what's going on.""if only we could recognize that those who combat us in life do so out of hidden pain,

"Everything Everywhere All At Once is even crazier than the trailer would lead one to believe. It's bursting with so many original, weird concepts and ideas that no serious storyteller in their right mind would ever dare to put in their movie. But Daniels did. And it works with spectacularly effective results.These filmmakers choose not only to put every bizarre idea they could think of into their movie, but they ensure that every oddity adds something to the thought-provoking, emotionally resonant themes that pervade the story. So many angles can be explored surrounding this story of emotional connection and the things that distract from it.As Evelyn connects with her alternate selves and alternate relatives, there is both envy of and pity toward them that is explored. It's such a cathartic experience to watch this woman discover what she truly wants from life and loves about her life.All of the beautiful themes and heartwarming character moments are just the tip of the iceberg here, though. This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.The Daniels lean into the absurdity of the world that they have created, always reaching for the most outlandish possibilities and never playing it safe. It makes for some truly outstanding visual gags that will never leave my mind., and it makes for the most unique viewing experience I have ever had in my life.This is a masterpiece of originality. There is not, nor will there ever be, a film quite like this one. And I cannot wait to watch it again and again and again.","everything everywhere all at once is even crazier than the trailer would lead one to believe. it's bursting with so many original, weird

"Most of us who are mindful of the film can agree on one thing, Everything Everywhere All at Once feels like you're walking on an acid trip experience. It's an imaginary film that makes you feel like you had just swallowed a bottle of limitless pills, dopes, drugs or other substances that may similarly affect your consciousness and memories.And this movie deliversssssssssss that! Wow wow wow! Imagine if Dr Strange, Limitless, The Matrix, Click, Rick & Morty, Star Wars, Ratatouille and Manchester By the Sea combined to become a film, Everything Everywhere All at Once is the one! Now you must be wondering, how could Ratatouille and The Matrix complement each other to be in the same movie? 🤣🤣🤣 This question should be THE reason you should go support this film now in cinemas!Produced by A24, an independent film company, I was surprised at how they have pulled this off. Half of the film is located at an office, which is understandable considering A24 produces low or semi-budget films. But it's such a wonder how this movie could be so good with only so few places the movie took place for the first hour. What's even better is EEAAO occurred within closed and overcrowded spaces that may slightly trigger people experiencing ADHD, hypersensitivity and claustrophobia, pushing the film into maximum impact.This film is filled with action-packed sequences that will blow you brains out! It's fun, exhilarating, creative, hilarious and never-been-done-before! Adding up with the out-of-the-world concept and unique storyline, every fighting scene seems appropriately done and even if there's just so many styles and tones of scenes coming out from the screen, fitting is the right word to describe them.EEAAO seems like any other movie at the beginning but when all hell breaks loose, the story becomes increasingly complex as it explains the world revolving around the central character, propelling the plot into motion. Meticulously explained, the narrative manages to be exciting and outrageously wild but reasonable within its own multiverse contexts.Michelle Yeoh, our Malaysian actress 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻, is excellent in this, proving that she's fluid in bringing out the best of her multiple character(s). Complicated as it is, she knew what kind of project she's doing and it just shows how dedicated she is at acting. It's not easy to play her role and it's definitely not easy to create multiple personas interconnected by different universes and dimensions, with separate storylines, all destined to have the same fate. This is an Oscar-worthy performance, and whether or not if Yeoh got nominated lies on the decision if the Oscar recognizes speculative fiction as a genre acceptable to compete with other highly-appraisal films.There were many genuinely laugh-out-loud moments throughout, NOT the one where you're forced to laugh just because everyone is laughing to avoid the awkwardness surrounding the audience in the hall, but the one that it's just funny you're having a truly good time. The script and performance help to amplify the comedic moment but the most special thing is that it's aware of its VFX effects and the team knows how to level up/down the intensity and realness of the CGI. How so? The CGI is very good, but there are times that the CGI is made to be purposely bad, like you're watching a short film by a bunch of ambitious varsity students, and it works! It works because everyone in the theater was laughing, it clicks just right with the moments and scenes you're watching. You'll laugh at how bad it is in a good way!If there's one dislike from this film is that it's gonna be a tough watch for some people. Like mentioned earlier, those with ADHD and hypersensitivity may be triggered with the intensity of this film. Also, the storyline is difficult for some to digest due to its complexity of its universe-building. The film is promoted as being light and fun but...EEAAO is weighty, dark, bizarre and surreal, only those who have what it takes can appropriately understand the building block storytelling.Verdict: Mind-bending and mind-blowing, Everything Everywhere All at Once masters its building block storytelling that feels like an acid trip worth experiencing and that experience... can only be felt once in a lifetime. We're only in March but without a doubt, this is already the best film of the year! Sorry, summer blockbuster movies!","most of us who are mindful of the film can agree on one thing, everything everywhere all at once feels like you're walking on an acid trip experience. it's an

"Some people seem to really love this movie, and that's fine. I hated it though, I bailed after 30 mins and have no desire to see if it got any less bad.Annoying, hyperactive gibberish. Here's a clue - if you want to hook your audience in, don't spend the first half hour of the movie having your characters bicker with each other and then introduce nausea-inducing camera moves on top of that.Michelle Yeoh is a great actor, and this studio has put out some great movies. But I am totally at a loss as to why everyone is banging on about this irritating mess of a movie. It's the cinematic equivalent of having wasps fired at your eyes for 8 hours.","some people seem to really love this movie, and that's fine. i hated it though, i bailed after 30 mins and have no desire to see if it got any less bad.annoying, hyperactive gibberish. here's a clue - if you want to hook your audience in, don't spend the first half hour of the movie having your characters bicker with each other and then introduce nausea-inducing camera moves on top of that.michelle yeoh is a great actor, and this studio has put out some great movies. but i am totally at a loss as to why everyone is banging on about this irritating mess of a movie. it's the cinematic equivalent of having wasps fired at your eyes for 8 hours.",some people seem to really love this movie and thats fine i hated it though i bailed after 30 mins and have no desire to see if it got any less badannoying hyperactive gibberish heres a clue  if you want to hook your audience in dont spend the first half hour of the movie having your characters bicker with each other and then introduce nauseainducing camera moves on top of thatmichelle yeoh is a great actor and this studio has put out some great movies but i am totally at a loss as to why everyone is banging on about this irritating mess of a movie its the cinematic equivalent of having wasps fired at your eyes for 8 hours,some people seem to really love this movie and thats fine i hated it though i bailed after 30 mins and have no desire to see if it got any less badannoying hyperactive gibberish heres a clue  if you want to hook your audience in dont spend the first half hour of the movie having your characters bicker with each other and then introduce nauseainducing camera moves on top of thatmichelle yeoh is a great actor and this studio has put out some great movies but i am totally at a loss as to why everyone is banging on about this irritating mess of a movie its the cinematic equivalent of having wasps fired at your eyes for 8 hours,people seem really love movie thats fine hated though bailed 30 mins desire see got less badannoying hyperactive gibberish heres clue want hook audience dont spend first half hour movie characters bicker introduce nauseainducing camera moves top thatmichelle yeoh great actor studio put great movies totally loss everyone banging irritating mess movie cinematic equivalent wasps fired eyes 8 hours,people seem really love movie that fine hated though failed 30 mind desire see got less badannoying hyperactive gibberish here clue want hook audience dont spend first half hour movie characters wicker introduce nauseainducing camera moves top thatmichelle yeah great actor studio put great moves totally loss everyone banging irritating mess movie cinematic equivalent wasps fired eyes 8 hours,"['people', 'seem', 'really', 'love', 'movie', 'that', 'fine', 'hated', 'though', 'failed', '30', 'mind', 'desire', 'see', 'got', 'less', 'badannoying', 'hyperactive', 'gibberish', 'here', 'clue', 'want', 'hook', 'audience', 'dont', 'spend', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'movie', 'characters', 'wicker', 'introduce', 'nauseainducing', 'camera', 'moves', 'top', 'thatmichelle', 'yeah', 'great', 'actor', 'studio', 'put', 'great', 'moves', 'totally', 'loss', 'everyone', 'banging', 'irritating', 'mess', 'movie', 'cinematic', 'equivalent', 'wasps', 'fired', 'eyes', '8', 'hours']",peopl seem realli love movi that fine hate though fail 30 mind desir see got less badannoy hyperact gibberish here clue want hook audienc dont spend first half hour movi charact wicker introduc nauseainduc camera move top thatmichel yeah great actor studio put great move total loss everyon bang irrit mess movi cinemat equival wasp fire eye 8 hour,peopl seem realli love movi that fine hate though fail 30 mind desir see got le badannoy hyperact gibberish here clue want hook audienc dont spend first half hour movi charact wicker introduc nauseainduc camera move top thatmichel yeah great actor studio put great move total loss everyon bang irrit mess movi cinemat equival wasp fire eye 8 hour
"It was everything everywhere all at once. Sometimes too many things, too many places at once and you can get lost, but it helps to focus on things.Obviously, the amazing Michelle Yeoh is one thing to focus on. The whole reason I myself came to see this flick in the first place. Much as this movie gives you to absorb it was easy to keep my eyes on the beautiful Yeoh.Oh, and the kid from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is in this flick. He's older odiously but he still sounds like the kid form The Goonies. How lucky he was he got to play Yeoh's baby daddy in this joint.Last and definitely not least it was good to see James Wong in this film. You could tell they most likely made some filming adjustments to assure the 90 something year old actor can do the role but that's what you do when you have legends do your flick.Speaking of legends, almost forgot about Jamie lee Curtis who seem like she was having fun in her role.The fact that this movie is about a multiverse I low key was expecting a multiverse connection between who Yeoh plays in this movie, and her character in Shang shi. That would have been cool.It's interesting that this like the third movie that came out in March that's about the mommy daughter relationship between Asian women. What's even more interesting is how they go in order. Turning Red is about a 13-year-old and Her mom, Umma is about an 18-year-old and her mom and the girl playing Yeoh's daughter looks like she's possibly in her early 20s. Don't know when this became a hot plot in movies, but I will admit I prefer how the story lays out here (but only because I relate more to an Asian woman in her 20s over a middle schooler)The music in this film is great. The movie was filmed in the context that the story is about a laundromat owner in her mid-life dealing with where she came from and where she's going, but the music actually fits perfectly into the ideal of this woman being the key to saving the multiverse and it made for a lot of the entertainment. Just these big orchestra cues that make it sound like I'm watching Dune contradicting, the image of Yeoh being a worn-out blue-collar mom. Spectacular!I say it's good. It's all over the place and it can be a handle to process, but it has a good cast to concentrate on.","it was everything everywhere all at once. sometimes too many things, too many places at once and

"Rarely does a movie hit me hard and I go along for the ride. Every moment has a spectacle to it. Even the simplicity of having your taxes done. Often silly, mostly confusing but entirely entertaining. It was great to see Short Round back on the big screen with a very glamoured down Michelle Yeoh as a married couple on the brink of fracturing a family unit.The story is of, Evelyn, a woman who has never really committed to much in life. She has many interest but many where she isn't fully invested in. In this case, her family lives above the laundromat that is failing. They are being audited, but yet she has big dreams to expand her enterprise. Her husband (the fore mentioned Ke Huy Quan) Waymond, is a kindly follower and believer of his wife who seems to focus more on the bad than the good. Pessimist, if we are to be formal. It is the Chinese New Year, and many people are invited to celebrate with this family, including a Grand-Father who is labeled as a man set in his ways and wouldn't understand the same-sex relationship of his grandaughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu). What follows is a grand adventure, first at the IRS building (of all places) and eventually to distant alternate universes to which shows her the way her life may have gone had certain things didn't take place. I absolutely loved the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis plays the uptight auditor, who seems perfectly fine in the core universe to which all revolve around. Evelyn, on the other hand, taps into her other universes to gather the skills needed to fight a fracture in the timelines that sneak into her mundane life.Yes, there is a message here. And...to be honest, it nearly derails the film itself. But it was required to tie in the meaning of everything that is going on. That we are made of experiences of every universe that exists out there (if you believe in metaphysics) and that they road you didn't take, through gained experiences, with some that even was more enticing then the present one, means we would never have known our other lives. Children wouldn't be born, love would be lost, relationships move on. It is the grand question of whether or not if we got a glimpse of that road we didn't take, would it all mean anything. In this case, I say it almost derails because the universes effect one another. And in this story, it even bridges them. Which to some, may feel like a cheat. However, the fact that I even ask this question makes it a vastly interesting story. That is for you to decide.The movie is exciting, vibrant, energetic and feels absolutely unique. It allows the viewer to slowly tie the ends together, and perhaps sometimes gets too far ahead. But doesn't let you lose yourself too much. What it isn't is boring. It is captivating and fresh. And, look, who can hate a scene of people being beaten with rubber phalluses?That said, it is one of the most interesting movies of 2022 and hopefully stays in the minds of awards in the future. Because it deserves a bigger audience. These are the types of fun, philosophical questions buoyed by comedy that we need.I go back to Ke Huy Quan. This guy can do funny and also bring a tug to your heart so easily. It's so hard to imagine him as the little boy from ""Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom"" because, here he shows so much range. His natural charm is shown through his love for Evelyn. He seems to be suffering through a fracture himself. He plays many roles here as well. Because, in many universes in life, the theory here may be that we will run into people we are meant to run into regardless of choices. That's a very romanticized view on the universe.Kudos to The Daniels for their talent and joy of cinema. It would not surprise me if they helm a larger film in the future. Perhaps they can re-vamp a comic book franchise into something much more unique.Thank you for this movie.","rarely does a movie hit me hard and i go along for the ride. every moment has a spectacle to

in life, the theory here may be that we will run into people we are meant to run into regardless of choices. that's a very romanticized view on the universe.kudos to the daniels for their talent and joy of cinema. it would not surprise me if they helm a larger film in the future. perhaps they can re-vamp a comic book franchise into something much more unique.thank you for this movie.",rarely does a movie hit me hard and i go along for the ride every moment has a spectacle to it even the simplicity of having your taxes done often silly mostly confusing but entirely entertaining it was great to see short round back on the big screen with a very glamoured down michelle yeoh as a married couple on the brink of fracturing a family unitthe story is of evelyn a woman who has never really committed to much in life she has many interest but many where she isnt fully invested in in this case her family lives above the laundromat that is failing they are being audited but yet she has big dreams to expand her enterprise her husband the fore mentioned ke huy quan waymond is a kindly follower and believer of his wife who seems to focus more on the bad than the good pessimist if we are to be formal it is the chinese new year and many people are invited to celebrate with this family including a grandfather who is labeled as a man set in his ways and wouldnt understand the samesex relationship of his grandaughter joy stephanie hsu what follows is a grand adventure first at the irs building of all places and eventually to distant alternate universes to which shows her the way her life may have gone had certain things didnt take place i absolutely loved the fact that jamie lee curtis plays the uptight auditor who seems perfectly fine in the core universe to which all revolve around evelyn on the other hand taps into her other universes to gather the skills needed to fight a fracture in the timelines that sneak into her mundane lifeyes there is a message here andto be honest it nearly derails the film itself but it was required to tie in the meaning of everything that is going on that we are made of experiences of every universe that exists out there if you believe in metaphysics and that they road you didnt take through gained experiences with some that even was more enticing then the present one means we would never have known our other lives children wouldnt be born love would be lost relationships move on it is the grand question of whether or not if we got a glimpse of that road we didnt take would it all mean anything in this case i say it almost derails because the universes effect one another and in this story it even bridges them which to some may feel like a cheat however the fact that i even ask this question makes it a vastly interesting story that is for you to decidethe movie is exciting vibrant energetic and feels absolutely unique it allows the viewer to slowly tie the ends together and perhaps sometimes gets too far ahead but doesnt let you lose yourself too much what it isnt is boring it is captivating and fresh and look who can hate a scene of people being beaten with rubber phallusesthat said it is one of the most interesting movies of 2022 and hopefully stays in the minds of awards in the future because it deserves a bigger audience these are the types of fun philosophical questions buoyed by comedy that

Firstly I should say I thought the actors did put in some very good performances and I can see why they were nominated although as to whether they deserved to beat some of their competitors is another matter.I have to say I found this film to be tedious and almost unenjoyable to watch. It feels like a film made for the TikTok generation - no overall coherence with nuggets of scenes rammed together. Is this a film I would ever bother watching again - absolutely not.Yes it is different - in much the same way The Artist was (and who talks about that film anymore?) but that doesn't make it good. It aims for a profound message whilst its style is overwhelmingly superficial. It's a film with little artistic merit or dare I say beauty (I am talking about the scenes and cinematography here not the actors) and it definitely did not move me except to pray it was going to finish.In short it barely ticks the boxes of what I'd consider to be essential criteria for a great movie. Maybe this is the first of a new wave of this type of film and I am not getting it but when it had finished I felt pretty much nothing.,firstly i should say i thought the actors did put in some very

"Greetings again from the darkness. It's bonkers, I tell ya'! Co-writers and co-directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, known collectively (by their choice) as ""Daniels"", follow up their 'farting corpse movie' SWISS ARMY MAN (2016) with one that is somehow more bizarre, more audacious, and more fun. It's one of the most innovative films I've seen in a while, and although I can point out influences, I've yet to come up with a movie comparison that seems just or fair.Every small business owner can relate to the stress Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh) is under as she attempts to organize her documents in preparation for an IRS audit of the laundromat she owns with her husband Waymond Wang (Ke Huy Quan). As if that's not enough, her father is scheduled to arrive the same day. She knows Gong Gong (James Hong) is disappointed in his daughter for the husband and life she chose. And while being crushed with those two events, Evelyn's strained relationship with her daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu) continues to fracture as Evelyn wants to keep Joy's girlfriend status with Becky (Tallie Medel) a secret from dear old conservative dad/grandfather.That's just about the end of the ""normal"" part of the story, other than Waymond has had divorce papers prepared, not for the purpose of ending the marriage, but with the hope that the threat might force Evelyn to have a real conversation with him about their relationship. Things start to get weird even before they head to the IRS meeting with an agent played with gusto by Jamie Lee Curtis, but while there, we get our first real taste of the fantastical trip we (and Evelyn) are about to take. Of course, I can't really offer any description of the action that occurs, but nothing is spoiled if I tell you that some characters cross multiple dimensions and universes in an attempt to 'save the world'. While doing this, they mix in some acrobatic martial arts that would make Jackie Chan envious.It's the rare film where the frenetic pace of dialogue keeps pace with breakneck action sequences. A fanny pack, trophies with an unfortunate shape, and blue-tooth type devices all play unusual roles here, and this film challenges everyone from the actors to the directors to the editors to the fight coordinators. You'll likely recognize Evelyn's husband as the grown-up version of the child actor who played Short Round in INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM (1984), and daughter Joy is portrayed by Stephanie Hsu (a contributor to ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel""), who gets to cover just about the widest range of character we've likely ever seen on screen. The estimable James Hong is a riot as Gong Gong. Mr. Hong is now 93 years old with an incredible canon of 450 credits in his 8 decades of work. His presence is quite crucial to the film. It should also be noted that, as we would expect, Jenny Slate shines in her brief role as ""Big Nose"", a regular customer at the laundromat.As terrific as the cast is, this is really a chance for Michelle Yeoh to bring her full arsenal to the role of Evelyn. She's angry, frustrated, scared, courageous, and even adds her comic timing. Ms. Yeoh flashes her CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON fighting skills, while also brining a regal presence to a film that requires a strong core. It's no mystery that family and love can solve many of the world's issues, and Daniels have delivered a wild ride that defies simple description. It's a long one at 139 minutes, but you'll thank me later for not saying much more than ... it's bonkers!Opens in select markets on March 25 and April 1, 2022 and nationwide on April 8,

attempts to organize her documents in preparation for an irs audit of the laundromat she owns with her husband waymond wang ke huy quan as if thats not enough her father is scheduled to arrive the same day she knows gong gong james hong is disappointed in his daughter for the husband and life she chose and while being crushed with those two events evelyns strained relationship with her daughter joy stephanie hsu continues to fracture as evelyn wants to keep joys girlfriend status with becky tallie medel a secret from dear old conservative dadgrandfatherthats just about the end of the normal part of the story other than waymond has had divorce papers prepared not for the purpose of ending the marriage but with the hope that the threat might force evelyn to have a real conversation with him about their relationship things start to get weird even before they head to the irs meeting with an agent played with gusto by jamie lee curtis but while there we get our first real taste of the fantastical trip we and evelyn are about to take of course i cant really offer any description of the action that occurs but nothing is spoiled if i tell you that some characters cross multiple dimensions and universes in an attempt to save the world while doing this they mix in some acrobatic martial arts that would make jackie chan enviousits the rare film where the frenetic pace of dialogue keeps pace with breakneck action sequences a fanny pack trophies with an unfortunate shape and bluetooth type devices all play unusual roles here and this film challenges everyone from the actors to the directors to the editors to the fight coordinators youll likely recognize evelyns husband as the grownup version of the child actor who played short round in indiana jones and the temple of doom 1984 and daughter joy is portrayed by stephanie hsu a contributor to the marvelous mrs maisel who gets to cover just about the widest range of character weve likely ever seen on screen the estimable james hong is a riot as gong gong mr hong is now 93 years old with an incredible canon of 450 credits in his 8 decades of work his presence is quite crucial to the film it should also be noted that as we would expect jenny slate shines in her brief role as big nose a regular customer at the laundromatas terrific as the cast is this is really a chance for michelle yeoh to bring her full arsenal to the role of evelyn shes angry frustrated scared courageous and even adds her comic timing ms yeoh flashes her crouching tiger hidden dragon fighting skills while also brining a regal presence to a film that requires a strong core its no mystery that family and love can solve many of the worlds issues and daniels have delivered a wild ride that defies simple description its a long

"This film almost unanimously received praise from both critics and audience alike. People even exaggeratedly rank it as one of the greatest films ever or the best they've ever seen. Going into this movie, my expectations were really high And I really wanted to be part of the majority who loves this movie. But unfortunately the opposite happened and I didnt like it. While I appreciate that this movie was made on a relatively small budget and managed to get some things right as it had so much potential with its strong female lead, philosophical component and some good action to move it along. But it fell really short. It is long and meandering. Visually confusing, thematically unoriginal. The first half was repetitive, boring and also quite silly. Half of the time I don't know what are they fighting for or what the heck is going on. And what was supposed to be the multiverse just felt like the characters were wearing silly different costumes. It is not until the last act that things of relevance happened. The performance from the cast was great though.","this film almost unanimously received praise from both critics and audience alike. people even exaggeratedly rank it as one of the greatest films ever

"It was my brother who recommended I watch this movie. He said it's crazy, but every time he thought to stop watching it, something else would happen to hold his attention. That wasn't quite my experience although I did stick with it to the end. I was also reminded of an almost identical experience some 20 years or so ago when a friend took me along with him to see a film he was raving about, ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" and that missed me by miles too when all that levitational martial-arts stuff started.Well, I couldn't get into ""Crouching..."" and I'm afraid it was the same for the sensory overload that was ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"". Go with the flow, sit back and let it happen is probably the best way to approach it but in the end, it was all too much for me.I sort of get the idea of multiple universes, where different versions of ourselves play out different destinies independent of what's actually happening to us in the here and now. Here though, the worlds are about to disastrously collide due to the emergence of an intergalactic super-criminal and it seems the first line of defence is Michelle Yeoh's unlikely middle-aged laundry owner Evelyn whose only concern when we first meet her is to get an almost unrecognisable Jamie-Lee Curtis's hulking auditor to sign off on the business's annual accounts and so keep her in business. Her dull husband then takes this moment to reveal that he's an alternative version of himself from what he calls the Alphaverse and that they are about to have the fight of their lives to try to thwart the approaching big bad super-villain whose identity I'll hold back from revealing.And that's your condensed plot. There are lots of characters straddling the universes you'd barely noticed earlier who suddenly drop back in and out of what I'll loosely call the narrative. Just when you think you've got a reasonable grip of one plot strand, it completely unravels and takes you in another direction.I certainly saw things I've never seen before or ever will again in a movie, including characters with hot-dog hands, a bagel as the centre of human knowledge, two inanimate rocks sharing a conversation and then there are the spoofs drawn from original features like ""2001"" and ""Ratatouille"" two films I didn't think I'd ever bracket in the same sentence.I also found the several attempts at humour to often be way too crude and vulgar for my taste, especially when you get two of the villains looking to boost their powers by sticking a sharp object up their behinds or another baddie getting knocked about by a set of male genitalia.Good luck to you if you managed to comprehend and actually enjoy this movie, but in the end I'm afraid it overpowered me into resistance. Maybe it was just some giant spoof of all those superhero blockbusters which have obsessed Hollywood for years. I don't know, but despite its successful box-office and the ratings here, I sort of wish that for two hours at least, I'd woken up in an alternative universe where I actually hadn't watched it at all.","it was my brother who recommended i watch this movie. he said it's crazy, but every time he thought to stop watching it, something else would happen to hold his attention. that wasn't quite my

startedwell i couldnt get into crouching and im afraid it was the same for the sensory overload that was everything everywhere all at once go with the flow sit back and let it happen is probably the best way to approach it but in the end it was all too much for mei sort of get the idea of multiple universes where different versions of ourselves play out different destinies independent of whats actually happening to us in the here and now here though the worlds are about to disastrously collide due to the emergence of an intergalactic supercriminal and it seems the first line of defence is michelle yeohs unlikely middleaged laundry owner evelyn whose only concern when we first meet her is to get an almost unrecognisable jamielee curtiss hulking auditor to sign off on the businesss annual accounts and so keep her in business her dull husband then takes this moment to reveal that hes an alternative version of himself from what he calls the alphaverse and that they are about to have the fight of their lives to try to thwart the approaching big bad supervillain whose identity ill hold back from revealingand thats your condensed plot there are lots of characters straddling the universes youd barely noticed earlier who suddenly drop back in and out of what ill loosely call the narrative just when you think youve got a reasonable grip of one plot strand it completely unravels and takes you in another directioni certainly saw things ive never seen before or ever will again in a movie including characters with hotdog hands a bagel as the centre of human knowledge two inanimate rocks sharing a conversation and then there are the spoofs drawn from original features like 2001 and ratatouille two films i didnt think id ever bracket in the same sentencei also found the several attempts at humour to often be way too crude and vulgar for my taste especially when you get two of the villains looking to boost their powers by sticking a sharp object up their behinds or another baddie getting knocked about by a set of male genitaliagood luck to you if you managed to comprehend and actually enjoy this movie but in the end im afraid it overpowered me into resistance maybe it was just some giant spoof of all those superhero blockbusters which have obsessed hollywood for years i dont know but despite its successful boxoffice and the ratings here i sort of wish that for two hours at least id woken up in an alternative universe where i actually hadnt watched it at all,brother recommended watch movie said crazy every time thought stop watching something else would

"Michelle Yeoh headlines this head trip into the multi-verse. The first part is slow going as this reality is not suggested in the previews and thus somewhat lulls the audience into expecting something different. But what makes this movie really work is its underlying storyline even as reading subtitles and trying to understand what is going on during the first half of the movie takes a bit of mental endurance. Allowing for that though, this movie bursts at the seams in being everything all at once, sequentially that is, in two-dimensions trying to project a four-dimensional reality and a multitude of parallel universes that all include Michelle Yeoh in some form or fashion. This movie definitely breaks through to a new level of sci fi visual delight and sophistication along with a strong storyline.

"This might be the most accurately titled film I have ever seen. Afterwards, my wife asked me what it reminded me of. I was stumped. What genre was it? Hard to say. This is a movie that morphs from immigrant drama to sci fi to Kung Fu to comedy to existential art flick and back again. Then it does that loop again, faster and faster and faster, without ever losing the audience. I saw it in a packed theater, everyone laughing and crying and caring. Perhaps most amazingly, this was a pretty simple and effective relationship story through it all. I don't know if I would rather watch it again right now or watch a documentary about how the film took shape. Either way, I'm glad it exists. I lamented multiverse stories after the last MCU film, and I guess I have to take that back now. It is possible to tell wildly imaginative genre bending multiverse stories. You just don't need superheroes to do it (unless you count the Daniels).","this might be the most accurately titled film i have ever seen. afterwards, my wife asked me what it reminded me of. i was

"Apparently the IMDb plot synopsis before this movie's trailer came out was ""a woman tries to do her taxes,"" and really, the plot's so creative and goes to so many unpredictable places that I don't think you should know much more than that going in. It is about a woman doing her taxes, technically, but branches off in a variety of ways that make this an action/adventure/absurdist comedy/fantasy/science-fiction/family drama all in one.All the tones and all the genres are balanced perfectly. It's masterfully written and overflowing with creativity. The editing is unbelievable and all the elements work together so well. It has some of the funniest and silliest scenes I've seen in ages that mesh perfectly well with some genuinely touching dramatic moments, and it has characters you really come to care for.The action delivers, too, and there's just the right amount of it. I love how thrillingly strange the film is for a while, then you begin to make sense of it, and then it just keeps expertly piling more and more layers on, and does so over a fast-paced 139 minutes in a way where it never actually falls apart. Also: it has some of the best film references/parodies I've ever seen, for sure.All the acting is fantastic, too, and everyone understood the insane vision the directors were trying to achieve, and played their parts perfectly. Michelle Yeoh is maybe the best she's ever been here, and Stephanie Hsu, Ke Huy Quan, and Jamie Lee Curtis are all great too.Maybe original ideas are becoming harder and harder to come by, but for as long as movies like Everything Everywhere All At Once are coming out, the medium of film will never be truly artistically bankrupt. There have been movies that have tackled some of the ideas here before, but never in a way that's this creative, this funny, and this exciting, and the way it takes its outlandish premise and ties it to real life + real world + relatable emotions is so incredibly clever.I haven't seen every movie of the 2020s of course, but as of writing this, this is my favourite movie of the 2020s so far. I hope it performs extremely well at the box office and gets awards recognition, because it deserves it.Believe the hype.Go in knowing as little as possible.See this movie.","apparently the imdb plot

"Leaving the movie theatre, I can barely comprehend the thoughts swirling around in my head right now. From the intriguing trailer, you wouldn't even begin to fathom the existential depths this movie submerges you under. Only to bring you back to the surface gasping for air just when things are at their bleakest.

Daniels accomplished just that with this work of art coming to me right exactly when I needed it. The themes of family, fulfillment, love, and everything in between hit resoundingly close to home. I'm so glad I got to experience this even if it doesn't win any Oscars which it absolutely ought to. If critics don't carry this little picture on all their best of lists I don't know what to do. The picture itself, Michelle Yeoh in Actress, Stephanie Hsu in Supporting Actress, Ke Huy Quan in Supporting Actor, Original Screenplay, Directing, Editing, Costumes, Visual Effects, Score., Sound, Academy please consider Everything Everywhere All At Once. I know it's a challenge given the absurdity of some of the plot beats of the film but when you boil it down it's a very heartwarming and affecting piece of cinema.","leaving the movie theatre, i can

"Did I watch a different movie? The entire beginning was a fast-paced convoluted mess of nonsense, that was also difficult to understand in between the fast subtitles and fast broken English. Sure, the story was unique, but all the attempt at humor was a fail, and thus made the story feel infantile. As for the acting, everyone was pretty much annoying except for Michelle Yeoh, of whom seemed to be the only one working her butt off. It's a very generous 6/10 from me.","did i watch a different movie? the entire beginning was a fast-paced convoluted mess of nonsense, that was also difficult to understand in between the fast subtitles and fast broken english. sure, the story was unique, but all the attempt at humor was a fail, and thus made the story feel infantile. as for the acting, everyone was pretty much annoying except for michelle yeoh, of whom seemed to be the only one working her butt off. it's a very generous 6/10 from me.",did i watch a different movie the entire beginning was a fastpaced convoluted mess of nonsense that was also difficult to understand in between the fast subtitles and fast broken english sure the story was unique but all the attempt at humor was a fail and thus made the story feel infantile as for the acting everyone was pretty much annoying except for michelle yeoh of whom seemed to be the only one working her butt off its a very generous 610 from me,did i watch a different movie the entire beginning was a fastpaced convoluted mess of nonsense that was also difficult to understand in between the fast subtitles and fast broken english sure the story was unique but all the attempt at humor was a fail and thus made the story feel infantile as for the acting everyone was pretty much annoying except for michelle yeoh of whom seemed to be the only one working her butt off its a very generous 610 from me,watch different movie entire beginning fastpaced convoluted mess nonsense also difficult understand fast subtitles fast broken english sure story unique attempt humor fail thus made story feel infantile acting everyone pretty much annoying except michelle yeoh seemed one working butt generous 610,watch different movie entire beginning fastpaced convoluted mess nonsense also difficult understand fast subtitles fast broken english sure story unique attempt humor fail thus made story feel infantile acting everyone pretty much annoying except mitchell yeah seemed one working butt generous 610,"['watch', 'different', 'movie', 'entire', 'beginning', 'fastpaced', 'convoluted', 'mess', 'nonsense', 'also', 'difficult', 'understand', 'fast', 'subtitles', 'fast', 'broken', 'english', 'sure', 'story', 'unique', 'attempt', 'humor', 'fail', 'thus', 'made', 'story', 'feel', 'infantile', 'acting', 'everyone', 'pretty', 'much', 'annoying', 'except', 'mitchell', 'yeah', 'seemed', 'one', 'working', 'butt', 'generous', '610']",watch differ movi entir begin fastpac convolut mess nonsens also difficult understand fast subtitl fast broken english sure stori uniqu attempt humor fail thu made stori feel infantil act everyon pretti much annoy except mitchel yeah seem one work butt gener 610,watch differ movi entir begin fastpac convolut mess nonsens also difficult understand fast subtitl fast broken english sure stori uniqu attempt humor fail thu made stori feel infantil act everyon pretti much annoy except mitchel yeah seem one work butt gener 610
"Michelle Yeoh owns a failing laundromat with her nebbishy husband Ke Huy Quan, who has just served her with divorce papers. They are being audited by IRS agent Jamie Lee Curtis. Her father, James Hong, threw her out when she married, and is now her wheelchair-bound dependent. Her daughter, Stephanie Hsu, has a girlfriend, which she cannot explain to her father. Then, during a terrible session with Miss Curtis, Quan takes off his glasses and in an authoritative voice tells her that only she can save the multiverse; from this reality defined by all the bad choices ever made, she must tap the abilities of the versions of herself who are more successful than she is; this means every one of them. She is the worst version of herself. Naturally, she is confused, particularly when she discovers that the ultimate evil that threatens all realities is her daughter.It certainly gives Miss Yeoh a chance to stretch her acting muscles and the editing is wonderful. This sort of story is an enjoyable ""wheels of time"" story, and tackles the nihilism at the heart of the subgenre: if every decision you make was decided differently in another universe, what difference does it make?My cousin enjoyed most of it but thought the ending sentimental.

"Wow. The first Top Gun is a classic, and as we all know, sequels/remakes rarely beat the original, especially 36 years later e.g. The Matrix Resurrections. Well, this film just broke that theory.Aside from the adrenaline-pumping edge or your seat action, this story also had heart. It successfully overachieves, and surpasses its predecessor on every level.The directing by novice Joseph Kosinski was outstanding, especially considering this was his fourth ever full length feature film. All the stunts, visuals and V/SFX were breathtaking, and the camera work perfection, that you'll feel you're in the cockpit of the jet. The soundtrack and score was amazing. The 131 min runtime literally flew by with its spot-on pacing. I actually wanted to see more. Casting and performances by all were also perfection, and once again Tom Cruise reminds us why he is still one of the top actors in the industry.There's nothing I can critique or wish was better, as this gem was perfect in every way. Absolutely stunning, action-packed with a compelling and emotional story, as well as being a visual masterpiece. And the fact the dog fights were real and not CGI (actors had to train to fly the jets), just makes this film that much more magnificent. I'll be definitely seeing this again and adding the DVD to my collection. It's a rare perfect 10/10 must see from me.","wow. the first top gun is a classic, and as we all know, sequels/remakes rarely beat the original, especially 36 years later e.g. the matrix

"If you were a late teen or in your early twenties in the mid 1980's the world was very different. No computers, no mobile phones, no internet, no DVD's. We had cars though, and bikes, and we loved them, and we loved films too. The original Top Gun captured this moment in time perfectly, and gave us a thrilling ride like we had never seen before. The humour, the games, the bikes, the aircraft and my word, those flying scenes. We went back to the cinema to see it again and again, and spent the following decades quoting the movie. As time went on, it remained like a static snapshot in time to perfectly represent that magical point in our lives for so many of us.Now, 36 years later, we are a generation that has lost our parents, we've had our own children who have moved on themselves, and we now approach the end of our own careers and our young selves are gone forever.This film is the missing bookend to that whole generation. The original was there for the start of our young adult lives, and this new film now marks the end. It's magnificent.I'm 55, but yesterday, just for one last night, I was 19 again.

"In one of the more memorable lines in the original Top Gun, Maverick gets chewed out by a superior who tells him, ""Son, your ego's writing checks your body can't cash."" Sometimes I wonder if Tom Cruise took that putdown as a personal challenge. No movie star seems to work harder or push himself further than Cruise these days. Ridiculously entertaining Top Gun: Maverick. Cruise was in his early 20s when he first played Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell, the cocky young Navy pilot with the aviator sunglasses, the Kawasaki motorcycle and the need for speed. In the sequel, he's as arrogant and insubordinate as ever: Now a Navy test pilot in his late 50s, Maverick still knows how to tick off his superiors, as we see in an exciting opening sequence where he pushes a new plane beyond its limits. Partly as punishment, he's ordered to return to TOPGUN, the elite pilot-training school, and train its best and brightest for an impossibly dangerous new mission. And so the three screenwriters of Top Gun: Maverick - including Cruise's regular Mission: Impossible writer-director, Christopher McQuarrie - have taken the threads of the original and spun them into an intergenerational male weepie, a dad movie of truly epic proportions. They're tapping into nostalgia for the original, while aiming for new levels of emotional grandeur. To that end, the soundtrack features a Lady Gaga song, ""Hold My Hand."" It's nowhere near as iconic a chart topper as the original movie's ""Take My Breath Away,"" but tugs at your heartstrings nonetheless. The action sequences are much more thrilling and immersive than in the original. You feel like you're really in the cockpit with these pilots, and that's because you are: The actors underwent intense flight training and flew actual planes during shooting. In that respect, Top Gun: Maverick feels like a throwback to a lost era of practical moviemaking, before computer-generated visual effects took over Hollywood. You start to understand why Cruise, the creative force behind the movie, was so driven to make it: In telling a story where older and younger pilots butt heads, and state-of-the-art F-18s duke it out with rusty old F-14s, he's trying to show us that there's room for the old and the new to coexist. He's also advancing a case for the enduring appeal of the movies and their power to transport us with viscerally gripping action and big, sweeping emotions.","in one of the more memorable lines in the

"This is one sequel that looked like it would never get made. It was stuck in development ""hell"" for years and years. Then it was delayed by COVID and other issues. Its almost as if we were not meant to see a sequel to Top Gun. But now it is here and the question is, was it worth the wait? The answer is a resounding yes. This is the only sequel I have ever seen that i liked BETTER then the original. EVERYTHING about this film rocks! Tom Cruise is sixty this year but he can still do the job! He is awesome as Maverick capturing emotions and giving a performance that he hasn't given since A Few Good Men. You see Maverick's innate cockiness (something all fighter pilots have I'm sure) but you also see his vulnerability and his pain especially the scenes where he talks about his dead wingman's son and how he can't bear the thought of him dying as well. Jennifer Connally and Miles Teller give great performances as well playing Maverick's love interest and Goose's son. Yes you 1980's music lovers we get to hear Kenny Loggin's Danger Zone at the beginning it is wonderful nostalgia. Oh and I should also mention the aieral sequences are the best and most intense in movie history you are on the edge of your seat the whole time. To wrap it all up I wanted to mention the touching scene where Maverick goes to see his old Top Gun classmate ""Iceman"" who is now an Admiral and dying of throat cancer. Val Kilmer looks so bad because he has had throat cancer and can no longer speak well. The scene is so sad but they have a joke at the end where he asks Maverick who the best pilot is? Go see this movie by all means!","this is one sequel that looked like it would never get made. it was stuck in development ""hell"" for years and years. then it was delayed by covid and other issues.

"What an excellent sequel - I, in fact, like it more than its predecessor.'Top Gun: Maverick' is fantastic, simply put. I was expecting it to be good, but it's actually much more enjoyable than I had anticipated. The callbacks to the original are expertly done, the new characters are strong/well cast, it has plenty of meaning, music is fab and the action is outstanding - the aerial stuff is sensational.The story is superb, with each high stake coming across as intended - parts even gave me slight goosebumps, which is a surprise given I'm not someone who has a connection to the 1986 film. It's all super neatly put together, I honestly came close to giving it a higher rating.Tom Cruise is brilliant as he reprises the role of Maverick, while Miles Teller comes in and gives a top performance. Jennifer Connelly is another positive, though her role does kinda feel a tiny bit forced in order to have a love interest; given Kelly McGillis' (unexplained) absence.Monica Barbaro stands out most from the fresh faces, though I actually did enjoy watching them all - which is something I thought the film may struggle with, adding new people, but it's done nicely; sure Jon Hamm and Glen Powell are a little cliché, though overall I approve.A great watch - I'd highly recommend it, though naturally would suggest watching the previous film first if you haven't already.","what an excellent

"See? This is why I LOVE Tom Cruise Post-Mid-1992. Aside from the RARE misfire, cough, cough, The Mummy, when Tom Cruise wants a movie to be better than perfect, he pushes it past Mach 10.The first half of this adventure made me feel this is the perfect and worthy sequel to the original. AND THEN...the second half kicked in thoroughly SURPASSING the original by a landslide. Now, it certainly will not have the impact on the 2020s as the original did for the 1980s - that's lightning that can't be caught twice. But, rest assured: this simultaneously saluted the 1986 classic and then told it to hold its beer.Maverick never changed. And just went he was about to use up his seemingly endless supply of luck, he got recruited back into the ""Top Gun"" division to get the elite ready for a, dare I?, almost Impossible Mission. Oh, and there's a ton of drama and obligatory dick-measuring thrown in.What matters most is: the setup for the film takes place perfectly in the first act giving us clear direction (something the original lacked,) and gave us goals with character building to anticipate and cheer on. When the climax began, it's WAS exactly what I wanted, until it went on another 15 minutes to make the movie SOAR beyond my expectations.While the acting was superb from the Veterans, it wasn't all that great from the fresh new recruits. That was to be expected. Much like their characters in the movie, they're learning to be the best. And they may someday.The movie's music is not as great as the original, but the movie used it sparingly, correctly and with some great new tracks. The original knew it had a killer soundtrack and overdid it. This one showed the restraint it needed.If you loved the first one, there's virtually no way you wouldn't love this even more. It's absolutely perfect for those who were there buying tickets for the original and it's also great for newbies so they can learn to appreciate the classics and understand: with age comes experience and that should never be mocked. It should be learned from and used to progress.And to Top it all off, all of the practical stunts and aerial shots made 10x more sense and easier to follow this time around. I just rewatched the original last night for only the second time (the first being on home video in 2015) and my head was literally spinning to follow the action in the sky. Here, they make sure no one is left in the dust.I can't recommend this movie enough and to see it in theatres, preferably a Dolby-certified one. Don't wait for Paramount+ to pick this up (like I normally would.) Go see this now on the big screen as it should be seen and don't miss out like I did with the original in 1986.***Final Thoughts: I *just* made my Top Ten Tom Cruise movie list, time to update it:1.

"It makes more than sense to have seen the first Maverick movie. I am writing this with that in mind. Actually I would even argue that the rating also had something to do with it. Watching it on the big screen also helps a lot of course. My summary line is actually a quote from the movie. Not just the first one, but one that is being said here too. And you will get the full impact of that sentence, of those words, if you know what they mean and why they are said.There are quite a few connections to the first movie, but there is also nods to real life. Especially with Val Kilmer in mind. And all is serving the story - even the real life struggle Kilmer has, that gets woven into the character Iceman. So there are two of the big stars of the first one name checked - what about Kelly McGillis though? Well don't hold your breath (it is being taken away, sorry for the pun)! She is not returning. Now you could be mad at the movie for that - or you could salute it for bringing ""back"" a character that was only name checked in the first movie - and being played by the wonderful Jennifer Connely.Now is she as beautiful as ever? Yes. But she is also close to the age of Tom Cruise that some other names could have been. Of course do not overthink the age thing, because you'd find that her real age would have been inappropriate during the time of the first movie ... just saying. Again: do not overthink it at all.Those things out of the way, we get introduced to a whole bunch of new characters. There probably is not as much ... well male on male energy here as there was in the first one. Even in the dialog - you just feel it. Don't give me that look (and yes I know it is the only one you've got - especially when I bring the puns)! There is more than a coherent story - and the movie takes its time to tell it. There is plenty of action too.There is also technical talk that I didn't totally understand. But it is not necessary to get the movie or enjoy it. And then there is the ending - and what a perfect ending this has. So much so, that I decided it deserves the 10 rating I finally gave it. It may copy many things from the first movie (call it homage), especially the intro but also some story beats, but it still stands ... or rather flies on its own! Just buckle your seatbelt, because you may get dizzy.First time watching I could spot the music cues from the first one, but there were also some fresh elements to it. If I didn't know Lady Gaga was at least partly (big parts if I understood correctly) responsible for the soundtrack, I wouldn't have guessed myself to be honest. As it is, one of the biggest highlights in cinemas this year - the waiting was worth it. If you feel the need .. the need for speed - your need will be satisfied here (or rather in cinemas). Even being able to predict story points will not take away anything from the experience you can have with this. Enjoy.","it makes more than sense to have seen the first maverick movie. i am writing this with that in mind. actually i would even argue that the rating also had something to do with it. watching it

"Having loved Top Gun, I clearly wasn't going to miss Top Gun: Maverick, and also being a fan of Tom Cruise, I knew the best place to watch it would be the big screen. I totally enjoyed the film as I watched it with a helping of popcorn. There were moments where I felt excited, emotional and even laughed along with the other viewers. It delivers light, simple and sweet entertainment in a delicious mix of action, drama, some romance and humor in a delightful manner.Tom Cruise shines in his performance where he is required to display a good range of emotions and has a good chemistry with Jennifer Connelly, while also impressing us in the action sequences as he always does. Speak of which, the action is very beautifully executed as well as filmed. Every time the jets turned, I felt like my head moved along in the same direction. This effect is repeated multiple times and ends up immersing the viewer into the thrill of the action. It's very clean and neatly done, and never violent at all. The film has no adult content, due to which you can watch it with your families.The music and score are terrific, and the cinematography is another major plus. Some might find the initial few acts a little slow, but the action sequences completely steal the show, especially in the lengthy and spellbinding final act. The editing is top notch, as the film never feels long or stretched. I was actually surprised how short it felt, and in a good way. Top Gun: Maverick is a very feel-good action movie with realistic action and emotions to deliver an experience of a lifetime. If you enjoyed Top Gun, chances are you will find yourself loving this film even more, for Cruise once again proves he's the man to look for when quality action is what viewers crave. Must watch on the big screen.

"Greetings again from the darkness. Heavy on melodrama. Heavy on cockiness. Heavy on fighter jets. Heavy on nostalgia. Check. Everything that we want and expect in the long-awaited sequel to the 1986 film is present. It's a movie spectacle featuring one of the few remaining bonafide movie stars front and center, as well as breathtaking action sequences that beg to be experienced on the largest screen possible and with the highest quality audio available. Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr are credited for the characters, while the new screenplay involved collaboration from Ehren Kruger, Eric Warren Singer, Christopher McQuarrie, Peter Craig, and Justin Marks. The original film's director, Tony Scott, passed away in 2012 at age 68, and Joseph Kosinski (OBLIVION, 2013, also starring Tom Cruise) takes the helm.Callbacks to the original are plentiful, and we get our first in the opening title card - the same one used in 1986 to explain the ""Top Gun"" training center. Of course, there is one reason we are here, and that's Tom Cruise. He was only 24 years old in the original, and now lives and exudes the swagger of Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell. When the film opens, Maverick is an extreme test pilot pushing himself and an experimental aircraft to Mach 10, and yes, this goes against the wishes and order of the program's Rear Admiral in charge played by a curmudgeonly Ed Harris. It's a shame that Harris only has a couple of brief scenes, but he is the one that informs Maverick of his new orders to return to Top Gun immediately. His new commanding officer is Beau ""Cyclone"" Simpson (Jon Hamm), who is none too happy about Maverick being back. However, the order came directly from Maverick's old nemesis/friend, Tom ""Iceman"" Kazansky (Val Kilmer), now a highly decorated Admiral in failing health.Maverick is disappointed to learn that he has been brought in, not to fly, but to teach a group of Top Gun graduates how to execute an extraordinarily dangerous mission involving extended high speeds at a low altitude, dropping bombs on the uranium enhancement plant protected by a mountain range, and then immediately elevating to a nearly impossible level to avoid a crash - all while being targeted by the enemies radar and defense system. The enemy goes unnamed so that the movie can remain timeless and avoid any type of political backlash. Plus, this film is about thrills and action, not a political statement.Being back means Maverick crosses paths with Penny Benjamin (Jennifer Connelly), who was mentioned briefly in the first film as an Admiral's daughter. She now owns the local bar, has a daughter, races sailboats, and still carries a bit of a torch for Maverick, although she's quick to bust his chops whenever possible. However, it's the pilots he's charged with training that cause the biggest issue for Maverick. One of them is Bradley ""Rooster"" Bradshaw. Rooster is the son of ""Goose"" (played in the original by Anthony Edwards), who flew with Maverick as his Radio Intercept Officer (RIO) and died in an ejection mishap. Rooster holds Maverick responsible and Maverick is still haunted by his friend's death. Goose is seen in photos and via flashbacks, and Rooster emulates his dad at the bar's piano. The conflict between Rooster and Maverick adds complications to the mission - and a bit of melodrama to the entire film.The newbies (and the Navy) consider Maverick a relic of a bygone era, so of course, 'instructor' Maverick takes to the sky to strut his pilot stuff. In addition to Rooster, the standouts in the new group include Phoenix (Monica Barbaro), Bob (Lewis Pullman), and Hangman (Glen Powell), the latter of whom, along with Rooster, tries to recreate that symbiotic relationship we originally saw with Iceman vs Maverick. Teller and Powell are both solid, but this aspect never really clicks like the Rooster vs Maverick piece.We can't help but notice that the dramatic elements seem to be more of a focus this time around. The biggest impact comes from the scene where Mavericks visits Admiral Kazansky (Iceman) at his home. Despite his well-known physical limitations, Val Kilmer delivers a memorable performance, and the two actors seem to relish this opportunity. The situation is handled with grace, and we are appreciative of Cruise standing firm in his demand for Kilmer to appear in the film. As for the love story between Penny and Maverick, it had to be a bit frustrating for Ms. Connelly to work so hard on an underwritten role, while Jon Hamm's constant furrowed brow and barking leaves him coming across as little more than jealous of Maverick.Obviously it's the fighter jets and aerial sequences that folks will come for, and spectacular and exhilarating are the best words I can find to describe what we see. I was fortunate to see his in IMAX, and if you have one near you, it's certainly the preferred viewing format. Thanks to the Navy and the training and equipment received by the cast, there is an authentic feel that's almost throwback in this day and age of CGI. We sense the speed and gravity pulls, even if we are never in peril. The aircraft carrier sequences are mind-boggling, though it's jets in the air that provide the energy jolt.Wise-cracking and heartstring-tugging moments fill the screen, and you can relax knowing Kenny Loggins' ""Danger Zone"" is back, while Berlin is thankfully not. Sand volleyball has been replaced by some semblance of shirtless and sweaty beach football as a team-builder, and yes, we get the patented Tom Cruise sprints - three times: on a treadmill, during beach football, and in a forest. The familiar sounds of Harold Faltermeyer's original score are back, this time enhanced by Hans Zimmer and an ending song by Lady Gaga. Those from the original who are absent this time are the great Tom Skerritt, James Tolkan, Kelly McGillis, and Meg Ryan (whose character is mentioned as having passed away). Producer Jerry Bruckheimer is back, though his partner on the original, Don Simpson, died in 1996 at age 52. Deserving of kudos are cinematographer Claudio Miranda, film editor Eddie Hamilton, and those involved with sound, visual effects, and music. For those feeling the need for speed, this sequel delivers; just embrace the cliches and familiarity, and predictability.Only in theaters (as it should be) Friday May 27, 2022.","greetings again from

"I don't share everyone's unbridled enthusiasm for this film. It is indeed a great popcorn flick, with outstanding aerial photography and maneuvers. But 10 stars? There are few, if any, movies that are perfect, and deserve that kind of rating.The problem with the film is the plot. It is so filled with age-worn cliches that one could easily tell what was coming from beginning to end. I mean, you had to know who was going to save the day at the end, and you had to know what was going to happen when Maverick jumped out of Penny's window. Those are just two examples of the many obvious plot points that you could see coming a mile away. I could list them all, but it would take up too much space here. Basically the entire plot was entirely predictable.The opening scene, especially, was straight out of Hollywood Screenplay Writing 101. I mean, seriously, how many times have we seen that subplot? Countless.There were no characters in the movie, either. They were all caricatures, stereotypes. No depth to any of them. They had their standard roles to play, and that was it.Did I enjoy the film? Sure, it was fun. Especially on a big theater screen with a loud sound system. Did I take anything away from the film? Did it make me think about anything after it was over? Nah. Will I see it again? Nah.I will give Tom Cruise credit for including Val Kilmer in the cast. Considering his health problems, that was a nice touch.So, yeah, enjoy the film. Sit back with your bag of popcorn and enjoy the g-forces. But don't pretend it is anything other than just another summer blockbuster.","i don't share everyone's unbridled enthusiasm for this film. it is indeed a great popcorn flick, with outstanding aerial

This is one of the best theatrical experiences I've had and I'm so happy someone has taken the practical route rather than throwing everyone into a green screen. I watched the first one many times and I can't believe this just topped it by a huge margin. Tom Cruise will be written as the most passionate filmmaker in history. I mean to put a whole cast in a bunch of f-18 jets and act in a jet as well as film yourself is a huge deal. If this movie does not cross a billion then there is something wrong with taste that people have these days. So called marvel fans. This is what you call a cinematic experience.

"Greetings from Lithuania.I wasn't the biggest fan of first ""Top Gun"" movie. I saw it like 5 years ago so for me it wasn't nostalic or anything. It was just OK movie and nothing more.Today i saw ""Top Gun: Maverick"" (2022) in cinema. And it blew me away. This movie was incredible. It literally put a smile on my face. Action scenes in the air were the best i ever saw of this type of action. Directing by Joseph Kosinski was perfect. Music was on spot. Cinematography was gorgeous. I loved how actually calm and quite this movie was, until it wasn't and transition between scenes, acts, calm and action was perfect. Acting was great. This is a movie making as good as it gets. Was it predictable? Yes. But at the same time i was excited and glued to the screen during its whole 2 hours run time.Overall, ""Top Gun: Maverick"" is a Hollywood blockbuster done right. Its a Hollywood action adventure movie in every possible way, yet this time its done incredibly good. What a terrific sequel.","greetings from lithuania.i wasn't the biggest fan of first ""top gun"" movie. i saw it like 5 years ago so for me it wasn't nostalic or anything. it was just ok movie and

"Tom Cruise is still an ultimate being at 59 years old it's outstanding! Top Gun: Maverick deserves so much for how practical everything is. Great the IMDb rating is 8.7 hope it stays high, should even get awards. The music hit the spot, cinematography is beautiful, the story flow well, and the acting is incredible so much so that even though Val Kilmer has mouth cancer in real life he has a small part in the film. I like how the main characters trained for a near impossible mission that all was built up quite well.","tom cruise is still an ultimate being at 59 years old it's outstanding! top gun: maverick deserves so much for how practical everything is. great the imdb rating is 8.7 hope it stays high, should even get awards. the music hit the spot, cinematography is beautiful, the story flow well, and the acting is incredible so much so that even though val kilmer has mouth cancer in real life he has a small part in the film. i like how the main characters trained for a near impossible mission that all was built up quite well.",tom cruise is still an ultimate being at 59 years old its outstanding top gun maverick deserves so much for how practical everything is great the imdb rating is 87 hope it stays high should even get awards the music hit the spot cinematography is beautiful the story flow well and the acting is incredible so much so that even though val kilmer has mouth cancer in real life he has a small part in the film i like how the main characters trained for a near impossible mission that all was built up quite well,tom cruise is still an ultimate being at 59 years old its outstanding top gun maverick deserves so much for how practical everything is great the imdb rating is 87 hope it stays high should even get awards the music hit the spot cinematography is beautiful the story flow well and the acting is incredible so much so that even though val kilmer has mouth cancer in real life he has a small part in the film i like how the main characters trained for a near impossible mission that all was built up quite well,tom cruise still ultimate 59 years old outstanding top gun maverick deserves much practical everything great imdb rating 87 hope stays high even get awards music hit spot cinematography beautiful story flow well acting incredible much even though val kilmer mouth cancer real life small part film like main characters trained near impossible mission built quite well,tom cruise still ultimate 59 years old outstanding top gun maverick deserves much practical everything great limb rating 87 hope stays high even get awards music hit spot cinematography beautiful story flow well acting incredible much even though val killer mouth cancer real life small part film like main characters trained near impossible mission built quite well,"['tom', 'cruise', 'still', 'ultimate', '59', 'years', 'old', 'outstanding', 'top', 'gun', 'maverick', 'deserves', 'much', 'practical', 'everything', 'great', 'limb', 'rating', '87', 'hope', 'stays', 'high', 'even', 'get', 'awards', 'music', 'hit', 'spot', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'story', 'flow', 'well', 'acting', 'incredible', 'much', 'even', 'though', 'val', 'killer', 'mouth', 'cancer', 'real', 'life', 'small', 'part', 'film', 'like', 'main', 'characters', 'trained', 'near', 'impossible', 'mission', 'built', 'quite', 'well']",tom cruis still ultim 59 year old outstand top gun maverick deserv much practic everyth great limb rate 87 hope stay high even get award music hit spot cinematographi beauti stori flow well act incred much even though val killer mouth cancer real life small part film like main charact train near imposs mission built quit well,tom cruis still ultim 59 year old outstand top gun maverick deserv much practic everyth great limb rate 87 hope stay high even get award music hit spot cinematographi beauti stori flow well act incred much even though val killer mouth cancer real life small part film like main charact train near imposs mission built quit well

"Based on the scores, I was expecting a much better film. But I now get it., its the nostalgia for the first film that fuels the scores for this film.Here is my take and why I think its an ""okay"" film, just not a great one. There really isn't a whole lot of meat and potatoes to this story. It's largely a copy pasta in large chunks from the older film but with newer,
younger faces. Maverick is charged with training a squadron of top gun fighter pilots to destroy an enemy uranium enrichment plant that is about to come online and operational. But it seems the producers want to maximize the profits for this film and not offend anyone in the real world. So this enemy doesn't have a name or a geographical location. The enemy has 5th generation fighter jets and some James Bond evil villian sized SAM batteries around the mountain's summit. It is a snow covered terrain so that rules out many enemies in warmer climates.Then there is the lone aircraft carrier delivering these jet fighters to the enemies doorstep. Well, by now most people know that wouldn't be the case. Carriers are heavily guarded and their presence would trigger the attention of any adversary. No way could four F18 sneak in under radar to blow up this plant unless we accept the enemy isn't aware of a huge freakin carrier of their shores. So there is nothing resembling a realistic scenario and that kept me from enjoying the story too much.The romantic relationship in the film has no chemistry. I just didn't feel any chemistry between Penny and Maverick. That's a first because you do have two very good looking actors and I always thought Tom Cruise to be great action actor. So no chemistry between Cruise and Jennifer Connelly is a bitter pill to swallow.What I did like about it was the cinematography and some of the action sequences with the dog fighting. But I didn't think the dog fighting were any better than the original film. In fact, the original film might have had better scenes. This film just has a lot of choppy editing to imply action.I think its a 6/10, but not a chance it's a 9/10. Maybe if they added a Tom Clancy inspired screenplay to the film I might have given it a 9. Maybe a team of seals to do recon before having the jets engage and with the aircraft carrier companied by a battlegroup flotilla. Aircraft Carriers just don't end up secretly off the shore of adversarial country completely alone, not in the real world.","based on the scores, i was expecting a much better film. but i now get it.,

"Firstly before my small complaint I will point out that I do like the movie.Now the complaint.

INCLUDING the serious minded Admirals. Great Performances all around.2. Every Scene flows so well. The time flew by.3. Many of the Jokes Landed Strongly throughout the Movie with the audience I was with. Especially the ""You Told Me Not to Think"" Scene. 😂🤣4. The Visuals of the Fighter Jet Scenes were Astonishing. They looked so good.5. The Story was good enough, on top of that, the suspense was built up throughout towards the Actual Mission.

"Wow!I have just walked out of the cinema, and feel absolutely buzzing, a two hour thrill ride, what a spectacular movie this was.I so often feel disappointed by hyped up films, but this deserves all the hype, and then some.Top Gun is a classic, one of those films we've all seen, and many love.

"I just got out of The BatmanThis movie really won't be for everyone!! Easily the darkest Batman movie yet. It is gritty, depressing and not a fun movie at all.This isn't your usual comic book movie, it's a detective movie, with more in common with Se7en, than previous Batman movies. The first two thirds of the movie are amazing, at one point I turned to my son and said ""This is a masterpiece"" everything works and is brilliant, I was 100% enthralled, but boy does it drop the ball in the final act.Of the cast Pattinson is great, Collin Farrell is ok, Zoe Kravitz was fine too, but she has zero chemistry with Pattinson (Keaton and Pfeiffer they are not), Paul Dano though, was incredible, especially in the scene in Arkham, whilst Geoffrey Wright is as great as he always is.On the downside, It does have some pacing issues, and is really too long (though I'm not sure what I'd cut), and I really wasn't keen on the ending (I don't know if it is a comic book storyline they did), as I think the final act really lets the movie down!! It's here, in the final act, that you feel the movies run time!!I was surprised there were only 36 other people in my screening.","i just got out of the batmanthis movie really won't be for everyone!!

"A serial killer strikes in Gotham City, killing important political figures, and leaving behind a series of cryptic clues, only Batman can stop him.It's certainly very different to all previous Batman films, it's definitely dark and atmospheric, but the pitch and narrative are very different. The Batman is told almost as a crime noir, made in a way that you could watch it in black and white to enjoy a different perspective.Interesting in that it's a real exploration of the character, his past and family, we get a sense as to why this Batman is so haunted.I wasn't blown away when I heard that Robert Pattinson was cast as Batman, Vengeance, but I was won over very quickly by him, clearly penned as a character with the weight of the world on his shoulders, this incarnation is dark, haunted, relentless, but strong and determined. Don't expect laughs or lighter moments, there aren't any.Andy Serkis awesome as always, I thought Colin Farrell and Paul Dano were great too.Great visuals throughout, Gotham looks terrific, and there are some terrific special effects, and a few duff ones too. I think Pattinson looked awesome in the costume, it was well designed.The music was fantastic I thought, one of the movie's best elements, interesting seeing so much carnage played out to Ave Maria, a real juxtaposition.I wish I could say it was without any flaws, as it is an epic, imaginative reimagining, one that deserved its success, however pacing is an issue, it feels long for the sake of being long at times, some scenes are painfully drawn out. Some of the dialogue was hard to make our at times too, was it me, or was some of it a little muffled?What I really didn't like though, the ending, that has to knock a couple of stars of the rating, it just didn't work.Interesting to see what comes next, this was an imaginative retelling.7/10.","a serial killer strikes in gotham city, killing important political figures, and leaving behind a

"I have been absolutely fizzing to see 'The Batman' from the day it was announced, but even more so from when I first heard it described as being inspired by 'Se7en' - one of my favourite psychological thrillers of all time. Were we finally going to get the raw and gritty Batman film I'd always dreamed of seeing? We certainly were.Where to begin? The biggest thing that struck me with this film was just how much time we got to spend with Batman, as Batman. There is very little of Bruce Wayne in this movie and I'm absolutely fine with that. The movie is Batman's story and we are with him from start to finish. We even get some narration from him, which I'm not quite sure how I feel about just yet. It was very good narration but I'm not sure he's a character I want it from.The Riddler in this movie is phenomenal. After The Joker in 'The Dark Knight' this is absolutely my second favourite Batman film villain. He was clearly inspired by the Zodiac killer and what an inspired choice. Also the use of the riddles in the film is nothing short of genius. These are very clever riddles and puzzles and make Batman have to do some serious detective work - something I've always wanted more of from him in the previous films.This is my favourite incarnation of Catwoman to date. I haven't loved her character's place in the films in the past. I've found she slows everything down and brings out a dull side of Batman that I haven't enjoyed. In this film though she was used perfectly. She's the love interest and a villain/anti-hero all in one. That is massive because it saves another thing that can often bog down a Batman film - the pointless love interest.The Penguin was probably the one letdown for me. From what I'd seen in the trailer I suspected this may be the case. I'm wondering if they were using this movie as a set-up for him and then in the second film he will evolve and have a lot more to do. In this one though I just found him quite a dull screen-presence.Robert Pattinson as Batman blew me away. He looked great and his voice was perfect. He was extremely intense and very menacing. Even though I knew he was more than capable of playing the role, I think I still needed to see the end product just for confirmation that he had what it takes. He absolutely did and then some.The film has quite a unique feel. There are scenes and sequences in this film that would feel out of place in both Tim Burton's Batman universe and Christopher Nolan's universe. But then there are little aspects from each of their respective films which clearly inspired parts of 'The Batman'. It basically took the best things from each of them and then twisted them into it's own style - while obviously adding a lot of its own stuff also. It's very well done in that sense.The Batmobile in this movie is awesome. There's just no other way to put it. The sound it made and the vibrations it sent through my cinema chair were bone-chilling. The chase sequence in this movie with The Penguin is one of the best I've ever seen.The film is long at just under 3 hours but it really never feels like it. There's a short period in the middle of the movie where everything slows down for a little while. That really is the only flat part of the movie however. The rest happens at a break-neck pace.It's hard to find enough good things to say about this movie. I need to see it again and digest a couple of things for a little longer, but for now I have it firmly sitting in second place behind 'The Dark Knight' in my order of favourite Batman films. 10/10.","i have been absolutely fizzing to see 'the batman' from the day it was announced, but even more so from when i first heard it described as being inspired by 'se7en' - one of my favourite

"The Riddler(Paul Dano, spot-on. How did it take this long for him to get a role like this?) targets public officials, revealing their corruption, and killing them in gruesome fashion(how did this get away with a PG-13 again? Oh, right, as long as you don't show the details, then you can get away with almost anything, by now. Even a barely toned down Jigsaw). In order to stop him, it will be necessary for the Bat and the Cat(with amazing chemistry), together, to stop the rat. Thanks, Matt.I really did not think that we needed yet another film dealing with Bruce Wayne's alter-ego. How about Nightwing? I know it's not likely, but part of me still holds out hope that Grayson will be turned into a feature(if you've never checked out the trailer on YouTube, you're missing out). But somehow, this managed to convince me. Fingers crossed for at least one sequel. Robert Pattinson is incredible here. Seriously, can we just stop freaking out every time the role is recast? The closest we've come to someone who shouldn't be doing it is George Clooney, and it's not like anybody came out of that flick looking good. He took that job after doing From Dusk till Dawn. There was good reason to think that he was going to be badass. Honestly, everyone here gives a strong performance.Something that will definitely appeal to some more than others, is the genre and tone. This is essentially Se7en meets Zodiac. It is not paced like a typical massive blockbuster. While the action is great, especially the martial arts, not to mention that car chase, there's less of it and it is smaller scale than for example the Nolan trilogy(which also has far more escalation). Essentially, this just isn't focused that much on that aspect of the titular icon. And I think we can all agree that we've had some great entries that deliver that. This is more interested in conveying to the audience that there's a reason he's called the world's greatest detective. We've barely seen it outside of the animated ones before, so I'm very happy with that choice by them.In addition to what I've already mentioned, this features some drugs, suggestive material and strong language. I recommend this to any fan of Batman. 9/10.","the riddler(paul dano, spot-on. how did it take this long for him to get a role like this?) targets public officials, revealing their corruption, and

fingers crossed for at least one sequel robert pattinson is incredible here seriously can we just stop freaking out every time the role is recast the closest weve come to someone who shouldnt be doing it is george clooney and its not like anybody came out of that flick looking good he took that job after doing from dusk till dawn there was good reason to think that he was going to be badass honestly everyone here gives a strong performancesomething that will definitely appeal to some more than others is the genre and tone this is essentially se7en meets zodiac it is not paced like a typical massive blockbuster while the action is great especially the martial arts not to mention that car chase theres less of it and it is smaller scale than for example the nolan trilogywhich also has far more escalation essentially this just isnt focused that much on that aspect of the titular icon and i think we can all agree that weve had some great entries that deliver that this is more interested in conveying to the audience that theres a reason hes called the worlds greatest detective weve barely seen it outside of the animated ones before so im very happy with that choice by

"Matt Reeves The Batman is a hell of a movie, it is the darkest live action Batman movie ever made, and the longest one too, The Batman fills with a top notch action sequence that not only exciting, but it's cinematic too, the cinematography was just incredible, Michael Giacchino The Batman theme song has just become one of my favorite movie theme song ever, it's enduringly great, the action is perfect itself without the theme but they making it even more perfect with the theme in the background especially when Batman shows up, it really making me hyped more because of that, Colin Farrell transformation is as amazing as his performance as The Penguin, Paul Dano performance is giving me a Heath Ledger Joker vibes but not trying to be Heath Ledger Joker which is still great, Paul Dano The Riddler is still a terrifying and a very disturbing villain, Zoe Kravits performances as Catwoman was amazing though she is not as wild as Michelle Pfeiffer in Batman Returns but boy did her gesture and look is as wild as Michelle Pfeiffer, and the Catwoman fighting sequence is definitely a win for Zoe and i did still like her a lot in here, and in the end we got The Batman himself, Robert Pattinson, all i can say about him as The Batman is that i hope everybody is starting to know him as the guy who play The Batman which is a really good movie and not the guy who play in the horrible Twilight film anymore because he is indeed an awesome Batman, now he was become my second favorite Batman next to Christian Bale in number one still, the story of The Batman itself is great, and my only problem with the movie is that there is quite a lot of particular scene that for me are just very slow or too slow, it's not boring but i feel like they can make it a little bit faster, if it's only one or two or three scene i probably still can forgive it but unfortunately it happens more than that, but at in the end The Batman is still a hell of a great movie, it's still amazing and it's still incredible, i was impress by most of the thing that happens, i was excited, i was hyped, i was stunt by all the amazing thing that they've done, The Batman is fire!!!.","matt reeves the

"STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulGotham City is rocked by a series of murders of key political figures, by a sadistic killer calling himself The Riddler (Paul Dano), who holds the city to ransom, revealing darkly guarded secrets and threatening more mayhem until he is stopped. 'The Batman' (Robert Pattinson), the alter ego of millionaire Bruce Wayne, starts an investigation of his own, crossing paths with a woman called Selina Kyle (Zoe Kravitz), who operates as 'Catwoman' and wants to find out what happened to her friend. It sets them both on a collision course with the darkest elements of Gotham's underworld, including notorious gangster 'The Penguin' (an unrecognisable Colin Farrell) and crime boss Carmine Falcone (John Turturro), who may be sitting on a devastating secret that could shatter both their lives.The Batman series must be one of the most enduringly successful franchises in the world of comic book films, appearing in various different incarnations since its original creation. Here, writer/director Matt Reeves delivers a mammoth three hour long interpretation of his own of the character that many seem to be hailing as the best ever. Less doesn't seem to be more anymore, at least not to the cinema artistes, but from this end, all I can see is a film drowning in its own indulgence.Reeves is obviously keen to maintain the bleak, heavy tone established by Christopher Nolan, and so we have a Gotham City with seemingly endless heavy rain, and gloomy skies, set against Pattinson's dark, brooding stare and gravelly voiceovers, set to the background of the emo rock soundtrack. It's just one of many things ripe for parody in a film that takes itself much too seriously and feels almost devoid of any humour and light. Even more overdone is Dano's dark 'Riddler', operating in some garish gimp suit that just looks ridiculous. Thrown in to this is the topical 'social justice' speeches that litter film and TV today, with Kravitz's Catwoman even praising the 'sinister' villain (who we're meant to hate!) at one point, for killing 'all these white privileged a$$holes.' It's just trying to cram a whole load of eggs in to one basket, over ambitious and overlong, and by the time of the main villain's grand 'master plan' at the end, you're too overwhelmed (or bored) to care.Everyone else can think what they like, but personally this is one of the most pretentious Batman's ever, which might have been a bit more bearable if it had just been less self indulgent, or at least had an old fashioned, Lawrence of Arabia style 'intermission' at some point. **","star rating: ***** brilliant **** very good *** okay ** poor * awfulgotham city is rocked by a series of murders of key political figures, by a sadistic killer calling himself the riddler (paul dano), who holds the city to ransom, revealing darkly guarded secrets and threatening more mayhem until he is stopped.

"Everything about this movie is trying too hard - the over dramatic score, the long shots on characters faces, the overacting, the complex crime story - it all feels like it's trying to get an Oscar in every moment.It's overly long, drawn out, and the story feels like a generic crime saga that has the Batman universe shoehorned into it.This movie is not a masterpiece, but it spends a lot of effort making you think it is!","everything about this movie is trying too hard - the over dramatic score, the long shots on characters faces, the overacting, the complex crime story - it all feels like it's trying to get an oscar in every moment.it's overly long, drawn out, and the story feels like a generic crime saga that has the batman universe shoehorned into it.this movie is not a masterpiece, but it spends a lot of effort making you think it is!",everything about this movie is trying too hard  the over dramatic score the long shots on characters faces the overacting the complex crime story  it all feels like its trying to get an oscar in every momentits overly long drawn out and the story feels like a generic crime saga that has the batman universe shoehorned into itthis movie is not a masterpiece but it spends a lot of effort making you think it is,everything about this movie is trying too hard  the over dramatic score the long shots on characters faces the overacting the complex crime story  it all feels like its trying to get an oscar in every momentits overly long drawn out and the story feels like a generic crime saga that has the batman universe shoehorned into itthis movie is not a masterpiece but it spends a lot of effort making you think it is,everything movie trying hard dramatic score long shots characters faces overacting complex crime story feels like trying get oscar every momentits overly long drawn story feels like generic crime saga batman universe shoehorned itthis movie masterpiece spends lot effort making think,everything movie trying hard dramatic score long shots characters faces operating complex crime story feels like trying get oscar every moments overlay long drawn story feels like genetic crime sage batman universe shoehorned this movie masterpiece spends lot effort making think,"['everything', 'movie', 'trying', 'hard', 'dramatic', 'score', 'long', 'shots', 'characters', 'faces', 'operating', 'complex', 'crime', 'story', 'feels', 'like', 'trying', 'get', 'oscar', 'every', 'moments', 'overlay', 'long', 'drawn', 'story', 'feels', 'like', 'genetic', 'crime', 'sage', 'batman', 'universe', 'shoehorned', 'this', 'movie', 'masterpiece', 'spends', 'lot', 'effort', 'making', 'think']",everyth movi tri hard dramat score long shot charact face oper complex crime stori feel like tri get oscar everi moment overlay long drawn stori feel like genet crime sage batman univers shoehorn thi movi masterpiec spend lot effort make think,everyth movi tri hard dramat score long shot charact face oper complex crime stori feel like tri get oscar everi moment overlay long drawn stori feel like genet crime sage batman univers shoehorn thi movi masterpiec spend lot effort make think
"I'm not sure where to begin as I don't generally want to spoil the reveals, but the big twists in the film were very anticlimactic. For 'The Batman'; Matt Reeves seemed to borrow from some of the bigger books such as 'Batman: Year One', 'Hush', and 'Batman: The Long Halloween'. Reeves also leaned heavily onto films such as 'The French Connection', 'Zodiac', and the noir classic 'Chinatown'. The general feel of the movie sought to relate Batman in the detective role that he's famous for in the comics, but unfortunately ignores any attempt at Batman's level of crime & mystery.The acting was really good. There's a great cast of professionals in this film, although Robert Patterson isn't allowed a range of emotion. Bruce Wayne and Batman are completely indistinguishable as the tired emo-kid who walks through life with severe lethargy. Colin Farrell is unrecognizable as the Penguin, and dare I say gave the greatest performance of his life. A large portion of the film is writing out a semi-origin story for Oswald Cobblepot and his rise to become Gotham's crime boss. A lot of the villains are the origin stories here. Batman (the character) is basically introduced the way he is in 'Batman: Year Two' and I thought that was a mistake. Year one of Batman would have been wonderful on screen. The audience seeing Bruce Wayne learning to use fear in his early days would have been a relief to this movie's ""Everyone is just scared of him."" plot device. Zoe Kravitz's performance as Selena Kyle becoming Cat Woman was under-developed, as she was so much fun to watch in 'The Batman' that I'd like to see this spin-off into a stand-alone Cat Woman release. Jeffery Wright was brilliant (of course) even remaining quiet in the Batman's background he pulled the attention onto himself, mostly because Patterson's portrayal was incredibly stiff. Paul Dano as The Riddler was exactly what I wanted to see in this movie. The character reached a new level of applause as a serial killer, but saddly that part of the plot was put on the back burner for the lackluster crime drama with Carmine Falcone. John Turturro was great as the crime boss Falcone, but the plot focused too long on his side story rather than offering more clues about the killings. It dragged on so long that it bored me completely. I went into 'The Batman' to see him match wits with a clever serial killer, not be re-educated about the connection between Thomas Wayne & Carmine Falcone again.The action sequences with the car chases and the fight choreography seemed old fashioned in a way. I knew before hand that Reeves lifted from some older better known films, but it's as if they dropped the budget on these scenes. Batman racing to catch the Penguin was an old muscle car Batmobile versus (what I'm guessing was) a 1980's Buick. I was laughing at this chase scene... it was presented with such seriousness that maybe if Penguin were in an expensive Italian sports car, I might have enjoyed it. But it was literally a supped-up car desperately trying to out pace my mom's car. The fighting was dull. Hand to hand combat is one of the first things Bruce Wayne learns before donning the cowl. But in this movie Batman is throwing punches a newly trained boxer would scoff at. So much of these scenes were empty and devoid of thrills and chills, that I wondered where the editor was.'The Batman' is simply too long. It's a ridiculous attempt to impress fans of it's own significance. It fails at cohesive story-telling and it basically pats itself on the back throughout the unnecessary musical score. Unlike the Dark Knight before it - I won't watch it again.","i'm not sure where to begin as i don't generally want to spoil the reveals, but the big twists in the film were very anticlimactic. for

"The headline can be taken two ways. If you remove any hype or expectations, saying it's a good movie is positive. But if you are hoping for an amazing new Batman iteration, good means it wasn't great, let alone amazing.This review will come off as negative but I did enjoy it. I love the tone. It's super dark and grounded in reality, even more than the Nolan trilogy. And it feels true to the character. Zoe Kravitz and Jeffrey Wright are great casting choices. It's a mostly well-made film and a good addition to the franchise. And the Bat suit looks awesome.At the same time, nothing about this movie wowed me. I did not connect with the characters, especially the villain. The relationships seem undeveloped and not organic. I was not nearly as emotionally invested in the story as I should have been. It mostly feels surface level.If you're a huge Batman fan, I think you will really enjoy it. But as a movie, I don't think it fires on all cylinders. The Nolan trilogy still reigns supreme.

"Even though I've seen all the Batman adaptations since the 80s, I can't call myself a superfan. Still keeps me entertained and some of the previous movies have been very entertaining. Robert Pattinson is for me the big draw, before I started watching this film. After his performance in The Lighthouse, I think he is a fabulous active actor. Versatile, deep and with an empathy in the roles that I think is often unique.So why do I think The Batman is only average?Robert Pattinson makes a good effort here too, with a dark and serious Batman. It's not his fault that I didn't find this highly entertaining.First, I think the script is too bland. I can't quite get the supporting roles. The film's villains remain somewhat tame and unengaging for me. This, in combination with the length of the film (it is long!), I fell off along the way.Feel free to continue using Pattinson in future sequels, but please; give him a better script than this. And no more anemic villains please!","even though i've seen all the batman adaptations since the 80s, i can't call myself a superfan. still keeps me entertained and some of the previous movies have

"Wasn't a fan of Emo Batman. Sorry Robert Pattinson. Film was just a bit bleh and felt like it was trying too hard to emulate Christopher Nolan and David Fincher.

"THE BATMAN (2022) *** Robert Pattinson, Zoe Kravitz, Jeffrey Wright, Colin Farrell, Paul Dano, John Turturro, Andy Serkis, Peter Sarsgaard. Filmmaker Matt Reeves pulls out all the stops in this even darker adaptation of the Bob Kane comic book hero with Pattinson standing tall and brooding as Bruce Wayne employing vigilante style justice as The Caped Cursader while Gotham quakes under the siege of the homicidal Riddler (Dano affectively disturbing) and gaining an unlikely ally in Selina Kyle (ass-kicking Kravitz in pre-Catwoman mode). Arresting visuals thanks in large part to ace cinematography by Greig Fraser and James Chinlund's production design all aided by the foreboding score by Michael Giacchino full of bombast and dread.

"I will say I liked the story, but the long dragged out and slowly paced near 3 hours was ridiculous. You could watch this at 1.5x speed and it would be more enjoyable. This needed at least 20 mins cut out and much faster storytelling. And the constant whisper dialogue in most of the film became annoying really fast.I do like Pattinson as an actor, but not as Batman in this one. He wasn't convincing and his monotonic whispering dialogue and Emo demeanor was very lackluster to the point of cringeworthy. And that's him both as Batman and even more so as Bruce Wayne.And what's with Colin Farrell being cast with all these prosthetics to play the Penguin? Was every other actor that naturally has that character's look unavailable? It's not like Farrell has a particular set of Penguin skills lol. Casting Farrell as Batman and Pattinson as Penguin, now that would've worked much better imo.I'm also a big fan of Westworld's Jeffrey Wright, but here again, he was very unconvincing as Gordon, especially when he also had that monotonic whispering Emo demeanor. I get that director and joint writer Reeves was going for that dark lonely dreary theme, but instead, the characters looked bored and inexperienced actors with sore throats.The only one that nailed their character perfectly was the lovely and beautiful Kravitz, who stole the entire show. I would've rather watched a 4+ hour movie with just her as Catwoman.All the Affleck, Keaton, Bale, Kilmer and even Clooney Batman characters were much more convincing, as well as having more and better ""keep you awake"" action in said films.Sadly, this one is a generous yet disappointing 6/10 from me.","i will say i liked the story, but the long dragged out and slowly paced near 3 hours was

"The Batman (2022) is a movie my wife and I caught an advanced screening of last night. The storyline follows Gotham shortly after ""The Batman"" has emerged and established himself in the streets. A serial killer known as The Riddler starts a killing spree of everyone influential within Gotham's hierarchy until Bruce Wayne in inevitably the target. How are all of these people tied together and can Batman tie the pieces together before Wayne is the next victim?This movie is directed by Matt Reeves (Cloverfield) and stars Robert Pattinson (Twilight), Zoë Kravitz (Kimi), Colin Farrell (Total Recall), Paul Dano (There Will be Blood), John Turturro (Do the Right Thing), Peter Sarsgaard (Garden State), Andy Serkis (Lord of the Rings), Jeffrey Wright (Shaft) and Barry Keoghan (Eternals).The storyline, look and feel of this movie is an A+. The characters are perfectly cast and well executed. Farrell, Dano and Kravitz were a 10/10.This movie does a fantastic job of depicting the Batman universe with the appropriate grit and feel and the lighting and cinematography is excellent. This also did a good job of creating various potential spinoffs with some subtle references within the storyline and at the end. This has a very good Jeph Loeb comics feel to it and does a good job delivering the ""Detective"" elements of Batman. The violence was also brilliant and very well done. I will say this did not need to be 3-hours and there are an abundance of scenes that could have been better edited. This film likely should have been a hair under 2 and a half hours.Overall this is a magnificent addition to the super hero genre and an absolute must see for Batman fans. I would score this a 7.5- 8/10 and strongly recommend it.","the batman (2022) is a movie my wife and i caught an advanced screening of last night. the storyline follows gotham shortly after ""the

"Matt Reeves is not a good director at all-- -he's made one decent film, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and everything else he's done falls into one of two categories: junk and overrated junk. (Thank goodness The Batman is at least the latter instead of the former). If the director wasn't trying sooooo hard to make the film 'dark' maybe he could have created a new category of just overrated.Firstly, David Fincher himself is bad enough, but David Fincher imitations are even worse. This movie's rote serial-killer plot indulges in every single one of the irritating tropes that Nolan already played around with, most notably the 'but he wanted to be captured!' eye-roller. (Also irritating are Reeves' cheap attempts to desecrate Schubert's music while indulging the trope of the classical music-loving psychopath). Modern culture's obsession with and inadvertent glorification of serial killers is one of my greatest pet peeves---they are just pathetic and boring characters who are all the same. Exchange the Riddler for any of the killers in Fincher's movies and there is basically no difference. And it irritated me to no end how practically every character allowed themselves to fall prey to the Riddler's petty mind games- - if I was there I would promptly tell him to p*ss off and take his stupid video calls elsewhere, even if there was a bomb strapped to my neck.Secondly, the casting is sometimes bizarre. DC has often thrived on unorthodox casting-if they can make Ben Affleck work as Batman anything goes-but they trip up here since we have the high-water mark of the Nolan trilogy to compare it to. Andy Serkis as Alfred? That completely does not work; he just lacks the sophistication of Michael Caine. The new Commissioner Gordon is no Gary Oldman, that's for sure. The Riddler joins the swelling ranks of villains desperately trying to imitate Heath Ledger. (The Riddler from the '66 Batman show was vastly superior--heck, Jim Carrey was). The new Catwoman is alright given the rest of this casting, but is rendered irritating by a script that causes here to carry ON and ON about some friend of hers that ends up killed. Why she's so emotionally attached to this friend is a mystery not even Batman dares solve. The closest thing to a saving grace is the infamously unrecognizable Colin Farrell as the Penguin--- the car chase scene was great even as I kept wondering why none of the vehicles were hydroplaning with something like a full inch of water on the road.Thirdly, the pacing is off. I've seen people accuse Nolan of being portentous, but The Batman takes it to a whole new level with it's bloated runtime. It doesn't even have the quasi-grandeur of the Snyder Cut due to the banal serial killer story which mostly requires people to pop in and out of the Penguin's club ad nauseam. Reeves said that he was supposedly inspired by Alfred Hitchcock, but other than a 'Rear Window' throwback in the opening scene I don't see it. The film is mostly shot like a generic TV procedural filtered through a David Fincher lens, and Reeves completely lacks the morbid playfulness that made Hitchcock so sublime. (Compare any Riddler murder to the one in 'Dial M for Murder', which is one of the more mediocre Hitchcocks). Reeve's sole technique for suspense is to have the Riddler hovering around in the background while an unsuspecting victim putters about.Ugh. If any good this would have become DC's highest grossing film ever. As it is, people will lose interest after a little while and the box office receipts will drop.","matt reeves is not a good director at all-- -he's made one decent film, rise of the planet of the apes, and everything else he's done falls into one of two categories: junk and overrated junk.

"I went in with ultra-low expectations because I think Robert Pattison is a god-awful actor and, this film took my expectations and made me promptly realise that, you can always go lower.I'm actually angry I wasted 3 hours of my life (and trust me, every minute of that time was felt).However, let's have some positives: cinematography is great and the music is fantastic. The opening scenes with The Batman made me think, I was going to have another Heath moment and be forced to eat my words because those opening scenes are indeed something special.But then the film gets going. Part ""Saw"" rip-off and so desperately wants to be ""Se7en"" in its execution, the story dragged. You don't care about any of the characters and I found myself pining for Clooney and his bat-nipples and Mr. Freeze.What I found really funny though is the producer of this utter mess got in touch with Nolan and warned him, ""We're going to make a better Batman than you."" No. Just no.Like the last Lord of The Rings film, this has an ending that just keeps on coming. Something wraps up and you start to get ready to leave, the film continues. Something else is wrapped up and you think, ""That's it..."" and it keeps going.... Something else, and on and on and on...I can see why the guy in the seat nearby racked up a massive line of coke and snorted it midway through (and no, I'm not joking... Welcome to Southampton).With regards to the plank of wood.... Sorry... ""Pattison"". In the initial scenes I was genuinely excited. Never a fan of his costume before, seeing it here - suddenly I ""got it"". He proper beats down on someone in a vicious attack. They get back up... In fact, everyone he bat-punches gets back up and just attacks him from behind again. There's no real threat here. When Bale smacked someone down, they stayed dead. But then, when Bale stripped off (same as Affleck), they were built. Robert looked like me and I look like Mr. Burns from The Simpsons. A skeletal mess with no beef there whatsoever. In fact, when Robert bent over in one topless scene, his bones stuck out and I thought wings were going to pop out. But then, why wouldn't they when he infamously said he refused to bulk up for the role (I would have sacked him there and then).His time as Bruce is strictly limited - thank God - so you can't really judge him for that. As Bruce he just stands there and looks confused. As The Batman, by the end he became a parody. His Batman voice changed to the same sound as the joke Batman in the college humour videos (A is for Alfred = genius). When he was mad, it just look like he was pulling a cum-face. And don't even get me started on the Adrian Mole diary keeping that's going in with the voice-over narration.Honestly, with the exception of the opening ten minutes or so, I have never hated a film so much as I did this and given I went in with low expectations, even I am surprised at how fuming I am at myself for wasting my time on it.","i went in with ultra-low expectations because i think robert pattison is a god-awful actor and, this film took my expectations and made me promptly realise that, you can always go lower.i'm actually angry i wasted 3 hours of my life (and trust me, every minute of that time was felt).however, let's have some positives: cinematography is great and the music is fantastic. the opening scenes with the batman made me think, i was going to have another heath moment and be forced to eat my words because those opening scenes are indeed something special.but then the film gets going. part ""saw"" rip-off and so desperately wants to be ""se7en"" in its execution, the story dragged. you don't care about any of the characters and i found myself pining for clooney and his bat-nipples and mr. freeze.what i found really funny though is the producer of this utter mess got in touch with nolan and warned him, ""we're going to make a better batman than you."" no. just no.like the last lord of the rings film, this has an ending that just keeps on coming. something wraps up and you start to get ready to leave, the film continues. something else is wrapped up and you think, ""that's it..."" and it keeps going.... something else, and on and on and on...i can see why the guy in the seat nearby racked up a massive line of coke and snorted it midway through (and no, i'm not joking... welcome to southampton).with regards to the plank of wood.... sorry...

"""It's a big city. I can't be everywhere."" Batman (Rob Pattison)
A more complete adaptation of the Batman comics presence there isn't, and no more gothic, spot-on condemnation of human frailty since the 50-year-old Godfather. Writer/director Matt Reeves' The Batman is arguably the definitive dark night of the American soul in its corruption and its salvation. As an achievement of robust American neo noir, it ranks somewhere behind Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver and Godfather.Batman (Rob Pattinson) scowls as if he came from a Twilight frame of mind while he shows a soft side in his love for Selena Kyle/Cat Woman (Zoe Kravitz), the Bat and the Cat, working to save the city from the likes of Riddler (Paul Dano), Penguin (Colin Farrell), and crime lord Carmine Falcone (John Turturro). Besides offing a large number of corrupt city employees, they offer Bruce Wayne a chance to learn about his obsession with his parents' public and private lives and their untimely deaths. Although none of the bad boys eclipses the impact of Heath Ledger's multidimensional Joker, even in his humor, together they are a powerful cast of darkness.Besides bringing together an ensemble of estimable actors in every role, Reeves gathers expert cinematographer Greig Fraser and production designer James Chinlund to create a darkness full of telling images while competing with the great film noir compositions of all time. Dark, yes, obscure, no. The darkness that envelopes each scene says more about the bleak side of humanity than any written treatise could.Besides the corruption of city officials, The Batman casts a shadow over the virtue of vengeance, embodied in Wayne's longing to account for the death of his parents and bad-boys like Riddler to assuage the pain of his childhood by terrorizing the city. In his favor, Riddler is ridding the city of corrupt power while Batman is cleaning it of its petty criminals. His stalwart ally, Lt. James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright), realizes that the real crimes are housed in his police force and ultimately his supervisors.The Batman is a hip and incisive representation of modern angst that not even a hero can relieve, at least not right now:To the strains of Nirvana's baleful Something In The Way: ""They think I'm hiding in the shadows, but I AM the shadows.""

"For better or worse (mostly better), The Batman is when he's detective first, superhero second. A bleak yet thrilling noir but also with a glimpse of exhilarating hope.

Pattinson and Kravitz were explosive together.","for better or worse (mostly better), the batman is when he's detective first, superhero second. a bleak yet thrilling noir but also with a glimpse of exhilarating hope. it doesn't hurt really if we're having a new batman film, especially if it took a riveting route like this. pattinson and kravitz were explosive together.",for better or worse mostly better the batman is when hes detective first superhero second a bleak yet thrilling noir but also with a glimpse of exhilarating hope it doesnt hurt really if were having a new batman film especially if it took a riveting route like this pattinson and kravitz were explosive together,for better or worse mostly better the batman is when hes detective first superhero second a bleak yet thrilling noir but also with a glimpse of exhilarating hope it doesnt hurt really if were having a new batman film especially if it took a riveting route like this pattinson and kravitz were explosive together,better worse mostly better batman hes detective first superhero second bleak yet thrilling noir also glimpse exhilarating hope doesnt hurt really new batman film especially took riveting route like pattinson kravitz explosive together,better worse mostly better batman he detective first superhero second bleak yet thrilling nor also glimpse exhilarating hope doesn hurt really new batman film especially took rioting route like atkinson gravity explosive together,"['better', 'worse', 'mostly', 'better', 'batman', 'he', 'detective', 'first', 'superhero', 'second', 'bleak', 'yet', 'thrilling', 'nor', 'also', 'glimpse', 'exhilarating', 'hope', 'doesn', 'hurt', 'really', 'new', 'batman', 'film', 'especially', 'took', 'rioting', 'route', 'like', 'atkinson', 'gravity', 'explosive', 'together']",better wors mostli better batman he detect first superhero second bleak yet thrill nor also glimps exhilar hope doesn hurt realli new batman film especi took riot rout like atkinson graviti explos togeth,better wors mostli better batman he detect first superhero second bleak yet thrill nor also glimps exhilar hope doesn hurt realli new batman film especi took riot rout like atkinson graviti explos togeth
"To preface this review I will say when watching this in the cinemas, many people walked out. I was looking over my shoulder to see of anyone else was laughing at what cringe this movie delivers.The actors in this were one of the highlights excluding the villain (the riddler) and the Batman. Penguin was by far the coolest and best actor. Honestly a good fellas type character. All other supporting actors were also quite good. I however think Robert pattinson a horrible pick for Batman. The whole time he seems like a really awkward and sad goth kid, I was half expecting him to say ""gosh get outta my room"". Absolutely trash acting The riddler was even worse! He was the major cringe factor in this movie with awful and dorky video calls where he is super non intimidating and laughable. His video calls reminded me of the horror films my 15 year old class mates had made in high school, their budgets were $0.The relationship between the Batman and cat woman was my only other plus in this movie. The romance was quite sweet and had a lot of tension. They rode around In their awesome motorcycles just roaring through the town it was really cute.The bat mobile was pretty awesome but definitely very weird for a Batman film. The old classic camaro was a little spine chilling not gonna lie.Now to answer everyone's questions I do think Robert pattinson was a terrible choice for Batman for a few reasons. At first I had no qualms but watching the film made me believe he was a bad and cringey actor for the role, he just isn't a badass over masculine kinda guy, like at all. He seems awkward and it shows. His voice wasn't that great, his body was not very big nor muscular like many other batmans, heck even the joker is ripped in suicide squad. The guy is 6ft exactly but his frame is tiny and it shows next to bigger actors. The story was God awful without spoiling pretty much lots of people die, bombs go off and some personal people Batman knows get injured. Then Batman goes welp I can't be in 3 places at once I'm only human. And proceeds to get ko'd twice throughout the movie and punched lots during fights. He is by far the worst and weakest looking Batman with the worst actor to have played him. The cinematography was good and the horror feeling this brings is good but everything else was just so horrible. Did I mention this film is 3 hours long to have a crap middle and end? Well know I know!. Wow I couldn't wait for thr 3 hours to end and multiple people walked out before the film was half finished. Definitely wouldn't reccomend this garbage piece of cinema. 2/10 for me.","to preface this review i will say when watching this in the cinemas, many people walked out. i was looking over my shoulder

"What's the one thought you had when Warner Bros. Casted Robert Pattinson as the Batman? Mine was 'Nooooooo!!!'. I was bewildered on the decision, questioning if this the best they've got for Batman? I didn't hate him but I was concerned if he could take up a big role like this as he doesn't have the regular features embodied by the titular character.And today's the day I witness myself that I was wrong, Pattinson is a great Batman. Hell, he slayed as Batman! Yes, his features don't really resemble the classic Batman, but he made it his own! This is one Batman that is better than Ben Affleck and George Clooney and audience would compare him to the likes of Christian Bale and Michael Keaton. Also, there's something about Pattinson's jawline that complements his looks everytime he's wearing the mask. He oozes his seemingly mysterious vibe that appears alluring enough for audience.2022's The Batman runs for about 3 hours long and what's special about this one is it offers a journey that doesn't dive into its origin story, making it a different piece compared to others. It's not centred on 'my parents were killed in the back of an alley when I was a kid', but it takes on a different story, focusing more on Gotham city and its grim corruption happening within.It's engaging throughout though it's not meant for some viewers because... the narrative isn't made for audience preferring commercial films. I would say the context and story are as rich as The Dark Knight and Joker. If you have a big issue with these two, I mean this as no offense but stick to Marvel.Like one of those PS4 Batman games, the film offers a bleak and dreary look at Gotham, transporting the audience into a world of transparency and reality. It doesn't shy away from showing us the rawness of the city; the coal-coloured alleys and underground tunnels, the debris scattered on the floor and the hard-hitting fact that no one is safe therefore, audience has an easy time relating themselves with our world filled with arising problems and issues.If you're wondering Zoe Kravitz did a good job as Catwoman, I would say yes. However, she's my least favourite compared to others who have held the same role like Michelle Pfeiffer & Anne Hathaway. She could've been better.Kudos to the makeup department for putting on such a brilliant work for Mr Penguin. If I hadn't known that was Colin Farrell, I would not have recognized him even a bit. Farrell did an excellent job as Penguin but there were a few times that he reminded me of Jared Leto's in House of Gucci with the overused accent🤣. And his character was mostly missing in the second half which was a let-down for me.What a brave decision when they did a 180° turn on The Riddler. They realized that Gotham is a dark place, they changed Riddler into someone darker than what the comic has offered. The Riddler is profoundly menacing and he will remind you of Heath's Joker in TDK once in a while. Paul Dano did a great job but... I felt they could have picked another actor. Prolly that's just me but hey, Dano is 👏👍.One of the issues I have is the overused soundtrack. For all 3 hours long, rarely you will encounter a scene with no music background 🤣. It takes away a bit of the grounded experience and the suspense that comes from it. If only they restrained the music much more, I believe this film would be scarier. What's worse is the music that was playing sounded quite the same with the next, it comes to a point where I felt irritated by it.Also, I wasn't impressed by the climax scene. It feels like they are not giving their best shot. It's just not 'ummphhh' enough as what has been hinted in the first two hours. Just when you thought it's the beginning of an exciting final battle scene is apparently almost the end of the movie.The reason behind this might probably be because of the not-so-formidable villain. Let's take a recent example, The Riddler is somewhat similar to Rami Malek's Safin in No Time to Die in terms of his capabilities and abilities; they both ace in strategy and planning but weak in combating, resulting in an almost non-existent final battle.Verdict: As if like a bleak painting canvas sold at a prestigious auction, The Batman exhibits an ambitious look into Gotham's gritty landscape all along strongly coloured with a frighteningly dour tone, illuminating what could possibly be the best movie of the year so far.","what's the one thought you had when warner bros. casted

"Oof, this movie hurt.""Aftersun"" is a slow build to a climax that left me openly weeping, to the point that I had to sit in the theater for a bit after the end credits were over just to compose myself.It doesn't even seem to be about very much for a while, just a melancholy story about a dad and his pre-teen daughter trying to enjoy a vacation at a run-down resort. But man, that ending comes along and wallops you, and you realize all at once that the movie is about so much, and that's it's been gradually revealing its layers to you all along.I seriously can't even think about this movie without tearing up. I think about that ending, about how the dad just wants to give his daughter a fun vacation while sinking into a black hole of depression, and the daughter, too young to fully understand the depths of her dad's despair wanting as an adult to go back in time and help him, and I want to bawl.Easily one of the best movies I saw this year.

"Like the very best art, writer/director Charlotte Wells's film MUST be seen more than once to be appreciated, fully felt and understood. Like the fragmented family it depicts, the film requires of its viewer connection, engagement, commitment.For example, on first viewing one wouldn't know the dark-haired woman dancing is the the adult Sophie, whose memories of a holiday with her father 22 years earlier make up the narrative. That dance montage recurs several times and at the end. On the last night of the Turkish holiday young Sophie declines her dad Colum's invitation to dance, but we see her adult version dancing and then the girl herself. Charactreristically, even when he's dancing with them he is dancing alone.The ending winds back to the beginning too. The film opens with Sophie filming a playful interview with her father two days after his birthday. That scene repeats later. At their airport parting Colum films young Sophie's playful ducking, posing and wide-grinned wave. A still of that grin freezes as a wall blow-up, from which Wells pans through the adult Sophie's flat, showing the pensive woman on her own birthday. That pan continues back to our (and Sophie's) last view of Colum, pausing his camera, walking back, down a hall and disappearing behind distant doors. The last-shot doors define hie absence.Like that last long pan through three sets, the film constantly plays with time. Instead of a throughway narrative we get the discontinuity of experiences remembered, shuffled, re-examined. The memory muddle explains the frequent asynchronicity, where the sound and image are at odds. We hear Colum on the phone in one position while we see him in quite another, tucking Sophie into bed. Sometimes he wears his cast, sometimes he doesn't.The key ambiguity is the shot of Colum walking fully-dressed into the night sea. It's an explicit suicide out of A Star is Born. In the next scene he's back in the hotel room. In a linear ploy he would have returned from the shore. But in a narrative that makes jumble and uncertainty its key principle that scene suggests his suicide. Not within that narrative period, but at some point, leaving adult Sophie searching her memories to deal with it.The film's central irony is that in this rare extended visit the young girl proves to have the poise, character and maturity of an adult, while her father reveals the weak, troubled helplessness of a child. Frankie Corio's performance of Sophie is miraculous. Her every look suggests a profound complexity of feeling. Freeze a frame and read. When she's locked out of their hotel room Sophie coolly sleeps in the lobby, then tries to assuage Colum's guilt. When she covers her father's naked body on her bed she's the adult tucking in the kid.Sophie is unruffled by overhearing two young girls discussing their sexual activity, the sexual play of the teens she meets over a pool game, the teens' later heavy drinking, even her spotting two gay men kissing in a doorway. The latter may shade Colum's ""new thing going with Keith."" Matter-of-factly, she tells Colum of her having kissed young Michael.When Colum tells her that as she grows up she should feel free to tell him anything, the shot has them on a small float in the distance, against a wide expanse of water, hills in the background. The scale conveys the futility of Colum's promise, his helplessness to support her.In an early shot we hear Sophie's steady breathing, asleep in the foreground, while on the balcony behind Colum labours through tai chi exercises - while smoking! The deeply troubled Colum is reading about meditation and tai chi. He's at loose ends, between girlfriends and jobs. Through Sophie's description of her fatigue the camera shifts to show his face registering a far more profound exhaustion.He is also in money trouble. Just before we see Sophie gifted an All-Inclusive resort bracelet, Colum picks up a cigarette butt to smoke. He overreacts to Sophie's loss of a swimming mask. He complains that the hotel room provides less than he paid for. He and Sophie skip out on a restaurant bill. In a rare impatience she asks him why he keeps promising things (i.e., singing lessons) that he knows he can't afford. His purchase of an expensive carpet seems to deny that - but he buys it in a spirit of gloom, not joy. We're glad to see it in the adult Sophie's flat.Over Colum's unseen heavy breathing we see the adult Sophie rise from bed, then assure her woman partner that she'll tend to their crying baby son. A blurry montage of Colum leads to his wakeup call for the day trip that celebrates his birthday. Young Sophie enlists the tourist strangers to serenade him. Cut from that ""jolly good fellow"" to Colum sobbing helplessly, naked, alone in a dark room.At their last supper Colum pays for a polaroid snap of them together. While Sophie wistfully wishes they could stay at the resort forever we watch the photo slowly developing, firming up to clarity, a miniature of the slowly revealing montages we have been absorbing.And so to the title. My (wise) wife Anne suggests Aftersun sounds like a catchy name for a sunguard lotion, something to treat burns. We see Colum applying protective balm to Sophie a few times. Her cascade of memories are an attempt to salve that emotional sear. Aftersun also seems an inflection of Afternoon, the halfway division of the day so by extension a pivotal point in Sophie's complicated memories of her dad.","like the very best art, writer/director

with itthe films central irony is that in this rare extended visit the young girl proves to have the poise character and maturity of an adult while her father reveals the weak troubled helplessness of a child frankie corios performance of sophie is miraculous her every look suggests a profound complexity of feeling freeze a frame and read when shes locked out of their hotel room sophie coolly sleeps in the lobby then tries to assuage colums guilt when she covers her fathers naked body on her bed shes the adult tucking in the kidsophie is unruffled by overhearing two young girls discussing their sexual activity the sexual play of the teens she meets over a pool game the teens later heavy drinking even her spotting two gay men kissing in a doorway the latter may shade colums new thing going with keith matteroffactly she tells colum of her having kissed young michaelwhen colum tells her that as she grows up she should feel free to tell him anything the shot has them on a small float in the distance against a wide expanse of water hills in the background the scale conveys the futility of colums promise his helplessness to support herin an early shot we hear sophies steady breathing asleep in the foreground while on the balcony behind colum labours through tai chi exercises  while smoking the deeply troubled colum is reading about meditation and tai chi hes at loose ends between girlfriends and jobs through sophies description of her fatigue the camera shifts to show his face registering a far more profound exhaustionhe is also in money trouble just before we see sophie gifted an allinclusive resort bracelet colum picks up a cigarette butt to smoke he overreacts to sophies loss of a swimming mask he complains that the hotel room provides less than he paid for he and sophie skip out on a restaurant bill in a rare impatience she asks him why he keeps promising things ie singing lessons that he knows he cant afford his purchase of an expensive carpet seems to deny that  but he buys it in a spirit of gloom not joy were glad to see it in the adult sophies flatover colums unseen heavy breathing we see the adult sophie rise from bed then assure her woman partner that shell tend to their crying baby son a blurry montage of colum leads to his wakeup call for the day trip that celebrates his birthday young sophie enlists the tourist strangers to serenade him cut from that jolly good fellow to colum sobbing helplessly naked alone in a dark roomat their last supper colum pays for a polaroid snap of them together while sophie wistfully wishes they could stay at the resort forever we watch the photo slowly developing firming up to clarity a miniature of the slowly revealing montages we have been absorbingand so to the title my wise wife anne suggests aftersun sounds like a catchy name for a sunguard lotion something to treat burns we see colum applying protective balm to sophie a few times her cascade of memories are an attempt to salve that

"Aftersun is a film that I wasn't sure I understood when the credits started rolling. Then, as I sat and thought about everything I had seen, I came to believe more and more that it's kind of genius.What the movie lacks in overt substantive plot it more than makes up for in authenticity and subtle placement of character-building images and dialogue. In the moment, these often feel like tangents and the overall picture isn't clear.While it can make for a frustrating first viewing, the clarity that comes with the film's final shot suddenly puts everything into perspective and I felt an overwhelming flood of emotion for the two central characters.Suffering happen more often than not in silence, and it's the cumulative of this film's many quiet moments that drive home one of the most effective, nuanced messages of compassion that I've seen all year.This is a masterpiece of subtlety, arguably slightly to a fault, but it's refreshing to

"It's been years since posting here and never before for a reason that entails major spoilers, so this is a serious alert: If you haven't seen the film and don't want major spoilers, wait til you've seen the film to read this. I myself went into this film, as i typically do, knowing nothing of what to expect (reading no reviews) and that surely accounts for much of the unprecedented degree of ""fog"" throughout my viewing (although the terrible audio we had, missing lots of dialogue, was also part of the fog), such that as we left the theater, baffled, i couldn't have imagined giving it an ""8"" or even writing here, but that's where the ""landmines"" come in ... After getting home, reading many critics' reviews, I began to see the film through such new eyes that i suddenly made sense of its plotline and meaning that went way beyond what any critic was saying. I just finished every 'user review' here too and it has persuaded me to write this because i don't see anyone interpreting it in the way I'm here to propose:I now believe that adult Sophie is (re)watching the camcorder that she has kept for 20 years with this one life-puzzle tape in it and now watches it (yet again?) with added poignancy and purpose for her now being the age her father was then. I believe she has probably rewatched this film many times searching for clues in her father that she didn't fully comprehend at the time. ""Aftersun"" may allude to a metaphorical ""sunburn"" she was left with from that trip and is forever dogged by.While for Sophie that trip meant reconnecting with a dad she loves and misses (wishing at the end that they could stay on together in hotels forever) and, despite all her hesitant inquisitiveness seeking to know dad better and how he sees the world, she had not at all perceived the ultimate purpose of the trip for her dad. In retrospect, he telegraphed the purpose of the trip for him in ways we viewers in the moment also didn't fully ""get"" as to their ""landmine"" potential: Especially when he teaches Sophie how to defend herself physically, to hold up her arms just right, etc., he becomes agitated that she isn't taking it as seriously as he wishes and urges upon her just how important this learning is. (Only he knows that he won't have future opportunities to teach her these things.) In other scenes, he's relaying life lessons about being true to herself, etc. For me the landmine only 'exploded' an hour after the film - to realize that Dad knew this was how he'd chosen to spend his last days, doing all he could think of to leave life lessons and self-protections for his beloved daughter's future life.We don't know what oppresses and depresses her father - and I believe two key scenes are in reverse-chronology (plausibly as adult Sophie's memory evokes them in that order): we see him enter the ocean and never return before we see him sobbing naked on the edge of the bed. (Of course, neither of those scenes can be from her watching the camcorder tape, i.e., they couldn't have been taped, but instead are either from adult Sophie's imagined scenes as to how some of her father's actions played out after she boarded the plane or from just the third-person narration stance that the film did often incorporate.) I believe a reason we'd seen dad fall asleep naked on the bed previously was background to give context when he sits naked and sobbing - and he's alone in the room. This is the truth of what happened after he left the airport through the double doors. He had planned this exodus but it filled him with grief nonetheless - a grief he'd been carrying since childhood when parents didn't remember his birthday(s) and he felt unimportant, untreasured, unloved - which would have given every reason for lifelong depression but we also could have been seeing a dad who was confronted, say, with a terminal illness or other reason besides ""simply"" depression. For whatever reason, I believe he bought the rug knowing it would be a tactile connection to him that he would be leaving for her (in his personal effects that would be sent to her). I believe he drank more at the end because as her departure grew close so did his intended plan to let the ocean take him away and he was drowning his sadness at leaving his daughter's world as he'd already decided to do. I think doing karaoke with her again was perhaps just too wrenching now that it was the eve of their final time together.I also believe that his saying ""I love you"" to Sophie's mom, that made her confused and curious could well have happened if, say, their marriage had ended because of his depression but there was still caring and love.I believe all this 'emotional history' of her two parents that she gets random clues about during that trip have become core pieces of a puzzle of who Sophie is to herself and yet adult Sophie still looks at the camcorder for more clues about what she might have missed in her father's words and actions during that trip.I think the 'disco shards' of memory that intervene in the film at times are adult Sophie's ongoing bombardments of puzzle pieces about her heritage - her parents' relationship that brought her into existence and what they were like ... given that at least one parent was capable of sheltering her from the full truth of his (suicidal) intentions.I myself find all these thoughts to be in the realm of over-interpretation, and I lay them out here partly as my own reality-check whether anyone else did see or could see the plotline and message in this way? Since none of the dozens of reviews I read tonight broached any of these readings of the film except for one commenter here who, almost as an aside, thought Sophie's dad at the end either a) went for cigarettes and disappeared or b) committed suicide, which the commenter sort of dismissed with an ""eek.""My own view entails no ""eek."" And if anything, especially reading all kinds of reviews that used the word 'vulnerability' to describe what her father seemed uncomfortable with. That made me think of Brené Brown's work (on the power of vulnerability - if you're not familiar google that on TED talks and join the 60+ million people who've watched her talk; many a suicide results from the shame of vulnerability) and how one possible message in this film could be a kind of outcry from an abandoned daughter, 20 years later, wishing her father - as she keeps rewatching him on the 'eve' of his suicide - might have not despaired to the point of ending his life because of shame or a sense of failure that may have undergirded his depression. And indeed some of young Sophie's questions of her dad on that trip can be seen as her probing to understand her dad's inner radar and (painful) life experience and learning.Please forgive my excesses of verbiage here or of what may seem off-the-wall over-interpretations. I write them largely to elicit whatever connection any reader might make and share to any of these notions of the film's message.

"I almost never watch films twice but 'Aftersun' was a rare case where I absolutely had to. I don't think this film can be fully appreciated on first watch. I saw someone suggest that after you watch it your mind will go back to little moments and re-evaluate their significance, and it will. But watching it again with the full picture gives the entire movie a different perspective. The second watch is almost like watching a different film.Kids in films, particularly in lead roles, can often be very annoying. That isn't an issue here. Frankie Corio gives one of the most likeable child performances I can ever remember seeing. Her chemistry with Paul Mescal was amazing. I read that she wasn't privy to Mescal's solo scene rehearsals, so that she wasn't fully aware of what his character was going through, much the same as her character Sophie wasn't. That's brilliant.Something that was very apparent on second viewing was the significance of the music in the movie. The first time through I remember thinking, ""there are a lot of good songs in this movie"". On second viewing you realise that every song used is telling a story. It's telling you what is going on, but like most people in the real world, we just hear a banging song and nod our head to it. Then later on we reconsider its true meaning.Finally, this film has one of the beast movie endings I can remember seeing. It's classy, heavy and thoughtful all at once. It's done in a beautiful and somewhat haunting way that will stick with me for a long time. 9.5/10.","i almost never watch films twice but 'aftersun' was a rare case where i absolutely had to. i don't

"This film seems pedestrian at first and for a long while into the story. Rather slow and mundane, it requires patience to allow yourself to settle into what might seem laboured and boring in that it's a rather simplistic story about a father and daughter doing the routine stuff we've all done on a package holiday. I'm not surprised some find it odd that the praise is so high for this film and for the acting because there isn't much overt straining of the acting chops here and nothing is addressed directly. I was sceptical until the last 40 mins or so. However, I realised that it is a film which exploits the art of storytelling from that place of reticence we all feel at times, when it's just too overwhelming to say how we're feeling and as a study in depression and regret it turns out to be very poignant and real in the end. Many have said they need to see it again to fully grasp the nuance here but I find that I will remember it for a good while and that is testament to the story and it's accomplished acting and direction, albeit very slight, almost whispers on a hot breeze. So, I'll set out how I understood it here, don't read on if you haven't seen it.His self loathing is revealed when he--mid normal conversation--spits at his own face in the bathroom mirror while maintaining a pretence at normality - talking to his daughter beyond the bathroom door. It was perhaps the first outright confirmation that he was depressed, full of a lack of self-worth and steeped in self beratment - actions which often accompany depression.Earlier, there were signs as he danced in silence on the balcony while smoking that his mental health wasn't great because it was off-kilter, an inappropriate moment to dance in silence, and to dance oddly as if self-comforting, nearly talking to himself, but not quite.The dim strobing scenes of dancing with Sophie as an adult flash glimpses of what she can now see, as an adult and mother, what she couldn't see then, a very serious and somewhat unhinged man, the reality of his state of mind she failed to see as a child. This is contrasted very well with the fond memories of her last holiday with him and there is one moment she recalls when he failed to wake and let her into their shared room, she was locked out, perhaps metaphorically and emotionally but gained access and found him naked on the bed. Perhaps this particular memory is her only clue as to his odd behavior that she recalls, but she sees him here vulnerable at last, perhaps clearly, and she pulls the sheet over his body as if to comfort and protect him while she keeps watch from the balcony.I found the place of his death unclear although I don't think we're meant to know exactly, some believe he stayed in Turkey, however I thought he handed her over at the airport in London (there was a sign marked London Luton) to a Chaperone. There is a non-contemporaneous shot earlier where he walks into the sea at night in Turkey, a clear signal as to his intentions, or perhaps the past when he committed suicide, just not maybe the exact place. This is confusing but doesn't change the sense of loss in this film.There is a palpable feeling of regret and he exhibits lingering love still for his daughter's mother and there's a sense that this is one-sided as alluded to by the daughter. Why say you love her if you're no longer together? There is also the picture of a man who hasn't been able to cope in the world and to succeed, as happens more than we care to dwell on ... the pressure on men to succeed and provide contributing to high rates of suicide in men. This is confirmed when his daughter berates him for offering to pay for singing lessons when she knows he can't pay for them. His shame is evident here.It's easy to just see this film as a mundane telling of a father & daughter on a typical holiday, however if you grasp his inner turmoil from the outset, that knowledge transforms the experience and culminates in a formidable and profoundly sad story of regret and trauma as a daughter, too young at the time to see the subtleties of depression in the man who was the father she loved so much, looking back and suffering, living with the loss and angst so many feel about not noticing that a loved-one was at that awful stage of being about to take their own life, but they didn't notice. There's huge guilt left behind as a consequence.In the end, this film is real cinema and reminds me very much of French cinema. It is accomplished and it is profoundly sad and moving.","this film seems pedestrian at first and for a long while into the story. rather slow and mundane, it requires patience to allow yourself to

the time to see the subtleties of depression in the man who was the father she loved so much looking back and suffering living with the loss and angst so many feel about not noticing that a lovedone was at that awful stage of being about to take their own life but they didnt notice theres huge guilt left behind as a consequencein the end this film is real cinema and reminds me very much of french cinema it is accomplished and it is profoundly sad and moving,this film seems pedestrian at first and for a long while into the story rather slow and mundane it requires patience to allow yourself to settle into what might seem laboured and boring in that its a rather simplistic story about a father and daughter doing the routine stuff weve all done on a package holiday im not surprised some find it odd that the praise is so high for this film and for the acting because there isnt much overt straining of the acting chops here and nothing is addressed directly i was sceptical until the last 40 mins or so however i realised that it is a film which exploits the art of storytelling from that place of reticence we all feel at times when its just too overwhelming to say how were feeling and as a study in depression and regret it turns out to be very poignant and real in the end many have said they need to see it again to fully grasp the nuance here but i find that i will remember it for a good while and that is testament to the story and its accomplished acting and direction albeit very slight almost whispers on a hot breeze so ill set out how i understood it here dont read on if you havent seen ithis self loathing is revealed when hemid normal conversationspits at his own face in the bathroom mirror while maintaining a pretence at normality  talking to his daughter beyond the bathroom door it was perhaps the first outright confirmation that he was depressed full of a lack of selfworth and steeped in self beratment  actions which often accompany depressionearlier there were signs as he danced in silence on the balcony while smoking that his mental health wasnt great because it was offkilter an inappropriate moment to dance in silence and to dance oddly as if selfcomforting nearly talking to himself but not quitethe dim strobing scenes of dancing with sophie as an adult flash glimpses of what she can now see as an adult and mother what she couldnt see then a very serious and somewhat unhinged man the reality of his state of mind she failed to see as a child this is contrasted very well with the fond memories of her last holiday with him and there is one moment she recalls when he failed to wake and let her into their shared room she was locked out perhaps metaphorically and emotionally but gained access and found him naked on the bed perhaps this particular memory is her only clue as to his odd behavior that she recalls but she sees him here vulnerable at last perhaps clearly and she pulls the sheet over his body as if to comfort and protect him while she keeps watch from the balconyi found the place of his death unclear although i dont think were meant to know exactly some believe he stayed in turkey however i thought he handed her over at the airport in london there was a sign marked london luton to a chaperone there is a noncontemporaneous shot earlier where he walks into the sea at night in turkey a clear signal as to his intentions or perhaps the past when he committed suicide just not maybe the exact place this is confusing but doesnt change the sense of loss in this filmthere is a palpable feeling of regret and he exhibits lingering love still for his daughters mother and theres a sense that this is onesided as alluded to by the daughter why say you love her if youre no longer together there is also the picture of a man who hasnt been able to cope in the world and to succeed as happens more than we care to dwell on  the pressure on men to succeed and provide contributing to high rates of suicide in men this is confirmed when his daughter berates him for offering to pay for singing lessons when she knows he cant pay for them his shame is evident hereits easy to just see this film as a mundane telling of a

"I am only writing this review so I can remember later on why I only gave this movie a 6. I understand that this movie has an extremely powerful and intimate presentation of the relationship between a reckless father and his young daughter. I noticed the intricacies and nuance that the film makers tried to convey throughout. I just did not connect with the film at all. I imagine that this film hit some people hard but for me I was quite bored with it by the end. I have to simply be true to my own feelings and opinions from a film and conclude that to me, it is simply ok. Don't take my rating too seriously because I can genuinely imagine somebody else watching this film thinking that it is the best thing they ever saw.","i am only writing this review so i can remember later on why i only gave this movie a 6. i understand that this movie has an extremely powerful and intimate presentation of the relationship between a reckless father and his young daughter. i noticed the intricacies and nuance that the film makers tried to convey throughout. i just did not connect with the film at all. i imagine that this film hit some people hard but for me i was quite bored with it by the end. i have to simply be true to my own feelings and opinions from a film and conclude that to me, it is simply ok. don't take my rating too seriously because i can genuinely imagine somebody else watching this film thinking that it is the best thing they ever saw.",i am only writing this review so i can remember later on why i only gave this movie a 6 i understand that this movie has an extremely powerful and intimate presentation of the relationship between a reckless father and his young daughter i noticed the intricacies and nuance that the film makers tried to convey throughout i just did not connect with the film at all i imagine that this film hit some people hard but for me i was quite bored with it by the end i have to simply be true to my own feelings and opinions from a film and conclude that to me it is simply ok dont take my rating too seriously because i can genuinely imagine somebody else watching this film thinking that it is the best thing they ever saw,i am only writing this review so i can remember later on why i only gave this movie a 6 i understand that this movie has an extremely powerful and intimate presentation of the relationship between a reckless father and his young daughter i noticed the intricacies and nuance that the film makers tried to convey throughout i just did not connect with the film at all i imagine that this film hit some people hard but for me i was quite bored with it by the end i have to simply be true to my own feelings and opinions from a film and conclude that to me it is simply ok dont take my rating too seriously because i can genuinely imagine somebody else watching this film thinking that it is the best thing they ever saw,writing review remember later gave movie 6 understand movie extremely powerful intimate presentation relationship reckless father young daughter noticed intricacies nuance film makers tried convey throughout connect film imagine film hit people hard quite bored end simply true feelings opinions film conclude simply ok dont take rating seriously genuinely imagine somebody else watching film thinking best thing ever saw,writing review remember later gave movie 6 understand movie extremely powerful intimate presentation relationship reckless father young daughter noticed intricacies france film makers tried convey throughout connect film imagine film hit people hard quite bored end simply true feelings opinions film conclude simply ok dont take rating seriously genuinely imagine somebody else watching film thinking best thing ever saw,"['writing', 'review', 'remember', 'later', 'gave', 'movie', '6', 'understand', 'movie', 'extremely', 'powerful', 'intimate', 'presentation', 'relationship', 'reckless', 'father', 'young', 'daughter', 'noticed', 'intricacies', 'france', 'film', 'makers', 'tried', 'convey', 'throughout', 'connect', 'film', 'imagine', 'film', 'hit', 'people', 'hard', 'quite', 'bored', 'end', 'simply', 'true', 'feelings', 'opinions', 'film', 'conclude', 'simply', 'ok', 'dont', 'take', 'rating', 'seriously', 'genuinely', 'imagine', 'somebody', 'else', 'watching', 'film', 'thinking', 'best', 'thing', 'ever', 'saw']",write review rememb later gave movi 6 understand movi extrem power intim present relationship reckless father young daughter notic intricaci franc film maker tri convey throughout connect film imagin film hit peopl hard quit bore end simpli true feel opinion film conclud simpli ok dont take rate serious genuin imagin somebodi els watch film think best thing ever saw,write review rememb later gave movi 6 understand movi extrem power intim present relationship reckless father young daughter notic intricaci franc film maker tri convey throughout connect film imagin film hit peopl hard quit bore end simpli true feel opinion film conclud simpli ok dont take rate serious genuin imagin somebodi el watch film think best thing ever saw
"After watching this beautiful film and coming across a little note from the amazing storyteller Charlotte Wells:(I cannot share URL apparently so please search ""A note from Charlotte Wells from the site of A24."")This was the word that broke me down. Hasret.I just couldn't resist my tears. As a Turkish person, its just both amazing and heartbreaking from the point of view of the director that this word resonates with her feelings from a place she had this holiday with her late father. That it stuck with her...Even though it is not the same case at all, I remember the times as a kid I closed the door on my dad because he would come home late from work. That because he would promise me to come home early.Now, today I can't even imagine how saddening it was for him at those times and it wasn't even at his hands.Hopefully I will be able to share my love and gratitude my parents as Charlotte did here with such elegance through some way.

"While Aftersun doesn't necessarily dive deep into the main subject matter, I think this works in its favour.Delicately unravelling the story of the two characters as they spend a holiday together in the 1990's. Scene by scene, we are given clues into Calum's mental health, and how he's subsequently battling with depression.What really makes this special is that it primarily plays out from the perspective of Sophie, his daughter. With a child's mind, it's harder to notice the emotional triggers and mood changes, which would be a red flag to any adult.While this film is definitely a slow burner, it works perfectly in this case. We are simply watching a father and daughter enjoy a seemingly normal holiday. Over time we see sneak peeks into Calum's mind, and how much he's struggling. But he's still trying to give Sophie the best holiday possible. You start to feel a slow tension building throughout the film, which hits (in my opinion) a really heavy ending.For me, in the final scene and following credits, I was left confused initially. But within a few seconds it all started to fall into place. With the final realisation that this was Sophie's last time she spent with her father before he (most likely) commit suicide. She watches back from a (now) adult perspective, and realises what her father was coping with - but was still trying his absolute best to make it special for her.This film wouldn't work if it was filmed in any other way. The slow pace really gives the viewer time to take in everything, as it's the small details that count here. An excellent film with excellent acting and a great soundtrack. Highly recommend.","while aftersun doesn't necessarily dive deep into the main subject matter, i think this works in its favour.delicately unravelling the story of the two characters as they spend a

seemingly normal holiday over time we see sneak peeks into calums mind and how much hes struggling but hes still trying to give sophie the best holiday possible you start to feel a slow tension building throughout the film which hits in my opinion a really heavy endingfor me in the final scene and following credits i was left confused initially but within a few seconds it all started to fall into place with the final realisation that this was sophies last time she spent with her father before he most likely commit suicide she watches back from a now adult perspective and realises what her father was coping with  but was still trying his absolute best to make it special for herthis film wouldnt work if it was filmed in any other way the slow pace really gives the viewer time to take in

"I am... actually speechless. And not because I cried, but because I don't know what to feel. I have a lot of thoughts after watching this movie, but I don't know how to grasp them. It's a very strange feeling I have witnessed only from a few movies I've watched in my life, and it isn't necessarily a bad feeling, but I'm just confused. A lot of things here are absolutely outstanding - the direction, the bond between the two main characters, and the screenplay. All this is great, I was entertained - in a very strange way. I maybe need a rewatch, I have to be older to fully appreciate the movie, but from the first watch, I'm more confused than pleased. But I would recommend watching it nonetheless, it's a beautiful piece of cinema for sure.","i am... actually speechless. and not because i cried, but because i don't know what to feel. i have a lot of thoughts after watching this movie, but i don't know how to grasp them. it's a very strange feeling i have witnessed only from a few movies i've watched in my life, and it isn't necessarily a bad feeling, but i'm just confused. a lot of things here are absolutely outstanding - the direction, the bond between the two main characters, and the screenplay. all this is great, i was entertained - in a very strange way. i maybe need a rewatch, i have to be older to fully appreciate the movie, but from the first watch, i'm more confused than pleased. but i would recommend watching it nonetheless, it's a beautiful piece of cinema for sure.",i am actually speechless and not because i cried but because i dont know what to feel i have a lot of thoughts after watching this movie but i dont know how to grasp them its a very strange feeling i have witnessed only from a few movies ive watched in my life and it isnt necessarily a bad feeling but im just confused a lot of things here are absolutely outstanding  the direction the bond between the two main characters and the screenplay all this is great i was entertained  in a very strange way i maybe need a rewatch i have to be older to fully appreciate the movie but from the first watch im more confused than pleased but i would recommend watching it nonetheless its a beautiful piece of cinema for sure,i am actually speechless and not because i cried but because i dont know what to feel i have a lot of thoughts after watching this movie but i dont know how to grasp them its a very strange feeling i have witnessed only from a few movies ive watched in my life and it isnt necessarily a bad feeling but im just confused a lot of things here are absolutely outstanding  the direction the bond between the two main characters and the screenplay all this is great i was entertained  in a very strange way i maybe need a rewatch i have to be older to fully appreciate the movie but from the first watch im more confused than pleased but i would recommend watching it nonetheless its a beautiful piece of cinema for sure,actually speechless cried dont know feel lot thoughts watching movie dont know grasp strange feeling witnessed movies ive watched life isnt necessarily bad feeling im confused lot things absolutely outstanding direction bond two main characters screenplay great entertained strange way maybe need rewatch older fully appreciate movie first watch im confused pleased would recommend watching nonetheless beautiful piece cinema sure,actually speechless cried dont know feel lot thoughts watching movie dont know grasp strange feeling witnessed moves give watched life isn necessarily bad feeling in confused lot things absolutely outstanding direction bond two main characters screenplay great entertained strange way maybe need reach older fully appreciate movie first watch in confused pleased would recommend watching nonetheless beautiful piece cinema sure,"['actually', 'speechless', 'cried', 'dont', 'know', 'feel', 'lot', 'thoughts', 'watching', 'movie', 'dont', 'know', 'grasp', 'strange', 'feeling', 'witnessed', 'moves', 'give', 'watched', 'life', 'isn', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'feeling', 'in', 'confused', 'lot', 'things', 'absolutely', 'outstanding', 'direction', 'bond', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'screenplay', 'great', 'entertained', 'strange', 'way', 'maybe', 'need', 'reach', 'older', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'first', 'watch', 'in', 'confused', 'pleased', 'would', 'recommend', 'watching', 'nonetheless', 'beautiful', 'piece', 'cinema', 'sure']",actual speechless cri dont know feel lot thought watch movi dont know grasp strang feel wit move give watch life isn necessarili bad feel in confus lot thing absolut outstand direct bond two main charact screenplay great entertain strang way mayb need reach older fulli appreci movi first watch in confus pleas would recommend watch nonetheless beauti piec cinema sure,actual speechless cri dont know feel lot thought watch movi dont know grasp strang feel wit move give watch life isn necessarili bad feel in confus lot thing absolut outstand direct bond two main charact screenplay great entertain strang way mayb need reach older fulli appreci movi first watch in confus plea would recommend watch nonetheless beauti piec cinema sure
"Aftersun is one of the most oddly touching and unique films of the year. The acting from the two leads was phenomenal. The cinematography and color palette was gorgeous. This is a very impressive directorial debut. As children, we don't know much of anything. It isn't until later in life when it hits us. That realization of finally understanding what you never understood for so long. Aftersun depicts this idea so perfectly. It is told through a woman remembering a vacation with her father, and how she realizes that she never really knew him. Depression is not always obvious. Just because everything looks okay on the outside doesn't mean everything is okay on the inside.","aftersun is one of the most oddly touching and unique films of the year. the acting from the two leads was phenomenal. the cinematography and color palette was gorgeous. this is a very impressive directorial debut. as children, we don't know much of anything. it isn't until later in life when it hits us. that realization of finally understanding what you never understood for so long. aftersun depicts this idea so perfectly. it is told through a woman remembering a vacation with her father, and how she realizes that she never really knew him. depression is not always obvious. just because everything looks okay on the outside doesn't mean everything is okay on the inside.",aftersun is one of the most oddly touching and unique films of the year the acting from the two leads was phenomenal the cinematography and color palette was gorgeous this is a very impressive directorial debut as children we dont know much of anything it isnt until later in life when it hits us that realization of finally understanding what you never understood for so long aftersun depicts this idea so perfectly it is told through a woman remembering a vacation with her father and how she realizes that she never really knew him depression is not always obvious just because everything looks okay on the outside doesnt mean everything is okay on the inside,aftersun is one of the most oddly touching and unique films of the year the acting from the two leads was phenomenal the cinematography and color palette was gorgeous this is a very impressive directorial debut as children we dont know much of anything it isnt until later in life when it hits us that realization of finally understanding what you never understood for so long aftersun depicts this idea so perfectly it is told through a woman remembering a vacation with her father and how she realizes that she never really knew him depression is not always obvious just because everything looks okay on the outside doesnt mean everything is okay on the inside,aftersun one oddly touching unique films year acting two leads phenomenal cinematography color palette gorgeous impressive directorial debut children dont know much anything isnt later life hits us realization finally understanding never understood long aftersun depicts idea perfectly told woman remembering vacation father realizes never really knew depression always obvious everything looks okay outside doesnt mean everything okay inside,aftersun one oddly touching unique films year acting two leads phenomena cinematography color palate gorgeous impressive directorial debut children dont know much anything isn later life hits us realization finally understanding never understood long aftersun depict idea perfectly told woman remembering vacation father realizes never really knew depression always obvious everything looks okay outside doesn mean everything okay inside,"['aftersun', 'one', 'oddly', 'touching', 'unique', 'films', 'year', 'acting', 'two', 'leads', 'phenomena', 'cinematography', 'color', 'palate', 'gorgeous', 'impressive', 'directorial', 'debut', 'children', 'dont', 'know', 'much', 'anything', 'isn', 'later', 'life', 'hits', 'us', 'realization', 'finally', 'understanding', 'never', 'understood', 'long', 'aftersun', 'depict', 'idea', 'perfectly', 'told', 'woman', 'remembering', 'vacation', 'father', 'realizes', 'never', 'really', 'knew', 'depression', 'always', 'obvious', 'everything', 'looks', 'okay', 'outside', 'doesn', 'mean', 'everything', 'okay', 'inside']",aftersun one oddli touch uniqu film year act two lead phenomena cinematographi color palat gorgeou impress directori debut children dont know much anyth isn later life hit us realiz final understand never understood long aftersun depict idea perfectli told woman rememb vacat father realiz never realli knew depress alway obviou everyth look okay outsid doesn mean everyth okay insid,aftersun one oddli touch uniqu film year act two lead phenomenon cinematographi color palat gorgeou impress directori debut child dont know much anyth isn later life hit u realiz final understand never understood long aftersun depict idea perfectli told woman rememb vacat father realiz never realli knew depress alway obviou everyth look okay outsid doesn mean everyth okay insid
"This film crept up on me. I was worried it was a gimmicky art film (plus at the beginning the dialogue was hard to decipher) but as the film went on I was swept up in it - purely down to Paul Mescal's and Francesca Corio's performances. Achingly beautiful. I was crying without realising and also on the tube home - the tears just kept coming but it was nothing to do with me.Alison Willmore from Vulture at New York Magazine perfectly articulated what I felt :' It's about wanting to reach across time, and to meet a loved one in an impossible space where, for once, you're both on the same level, and you can finally understand them for who they are - or who they were.'","this film crept up on me. i was worried it was a gimmicky art film (plus at the beginning the dialogue was hard to decipher) but as the film went on i was swept up in it - purely down to paul mescal's and francesca corio's performances. achingly beautiful. i was crying without realising and also on the tube home - the tears just kept coming but it was nothing to do with me.alison willmore from vulture at new york magazine perfectly articulated what i felt :' it's about wanting to reach across time, and to meet a loved one in an impossible space where, for once, you're both on the same level, and you can finally understand them for who they are - or who they were.'",this film crept up on me i was worried it was a gimmicky art film plus at the beginning the dialogue was hard to decipher but as the film went on i was swept up in it  purely down to paul mescals and francesca corios performances achingly beautiful i was crying without realising and also on the tube home  the tears just kept coming but it was nothing to do with mealison willmore from vulture at new york magazine perfectly articulated what i felt  its about wanting to reach across time and to meet a loved one in an impossible space where for once youre both on the same level and you can finally understand them for who they are  or who they were,this film crept up on me i was worried it was a gimmicky art film plus at the beginning the dialogue was hard to decipher but as the film went on i was swept up in it  purely down to paul mescals and francesca corios performances achingly beautiful i was crying without realising and also on the tube home  the tears just kept coming but it was nothing to do with mealison willmore from vulture at new york magazine perfectly articulated what i felt  its about wanting to reach across time and to meet a loved one in an impossible space where for once youre both on the same level and you can finally understand them for who they are  or who they were,film crept worried gimmicky art film plus beginning dialogue hard decipher film went swept purely paul mescals francesca corios performances achingly beautiful crying without realising also tube home tears kept coming nothing mealison willmore vulture new york magazine perfectly articulated felt wanting reach across time meet loved one impossible space youre level finally understand,film crept worried gimmicky art film plus beginning dialogue hard decipher film went swept purely paul rascals francisco boris performances aching beautiful crying without realising also tube home tears kept coming nothing madison fillmore culture new york magazine perfectly articulated felt wanting reach across time meet loved one impossible space your level finally understand,"['film', 'crept', 'worried', 'gimmicky', 'art', 'film', 'plus', 'beginning', 'dialogue', 'hard', 'decipher', 'film', 'went', 'swept', 'purely', 'paul', 'rascals', 'francisco', 'boris', 'performances', 'aching', 'beautiful', 'crying', 'without', 'realising', 'also', 'tube', 'home', 'tears', 'kept', 'coming', 'nothing', 'madison', 'fillmore', 'culture', 'new', 'york', 'magazine', 'perfectly', 'articulated', 'felt', 'wanting', 'reach', 'across', 'time', 'meet', 'loved', 'one', 'impossible', 'space', 'your', 'level', 'finally', 'understand']",film crept worri gimmicki art film plu begin dialogu hard deciph film went swept pure paul rascal francisco bori perform ach beauti cri without realis also tube home tear kept come noth madison fillmor cultur new york magazin perfectli articul felt want reach across time meet love one imposs space your level final understand,film crept worri gimmicki art film plu begin dialogu hard deciph film went swept pure paul rascal francisco bori perform ach beauti cri without realis also tube home tear kept come noth madison fillmor cultur new york magazin perfectli articul felt want reach across time meet love one imposs space your level final understand
"""There's This Feeling, Once You Leave Where You Grew Up, That You Don't Totally Belong There Again""For the past few weeks, I've heard and read a lot about people's reactions to this film, and I have seen nothing but unhindered love and affection. I was worried, and the reason for my worry was not the sea of scepticism that swept through, but the overbearing expectations that slowly grew deep within my conscience. I was doubtful that the film would live up to it, but now that I've seen it, I can say with certainty that it did, and in ways I never assumed.When the movie ended and the credits began to roll, I sat there in silence, at a loss for words and deprived of any sensibility to express how I genuinely felt. Aside from providing insight into a depressed soul and breaking open a portal to a self-loathing person's innermost despair, the most impressive aspect for me is how it made an instant connection, how seamlessly the film put across its message without ever becoming preachy or condescending in its portrayal.The touching relationship between Paul and Frankie (as Calum & Sophie) adds so much to the story's inherent ambitions. For a long time, I forgot they were actors, coming from different backgrounds; it almost felt like I was watching a real-life father and daughter spending some quality time together, reminding me of those good old days when I used to do the same with my father.Perhaps it's the film's simplified depiction of reality or its overwhelming relatability that made me fall in love, and I can't get

"A moving film about a girl reminiscing on a holiday to Turkey taken with her estranged father 20 years prior. The use of music is terrific, the two central performances are very touchingly delivered (Paul Mescal and the young Frankie Corio). It is one of the films of 2022. The fact this is Charlotte Wells' debut feature is nothing more than astonishing. She delivers massive assurance and confidence in direction, which pushes the narrative forward very tenderly as the girl (Sophie) tries to reconcile her relationship with her father Callum in two separate timelines.Along the way we are given snippets of her father's troubles. Wells' very cleverly weaves in a subtext that works to a crescendo in the last 10 minutes which includes one of the most brilliant transition shots in recent cinema (not hyperbole, it really is brilliant). The viewer is invited to join the dots on what has happened between the two timelines and there are several clues that help.Wells' debut has a familiarity with the work of fellow Scottish director Lynne Ramsay, and in particular her film 'Morvern Callar'. This feels lie the birth of another great director.","a moving film about a girl reminiscing on a holiday to turkey taken with her estranged father 20 years prior. the use of music is terrific, the

"It's one thing for a movie to be subtle and nuanced, but it's something else entirely to be enigmatic and cryptic. And, regrettably, the debut feature from writer-director Charlotte Wells delivers more of the latter than the former. This melancholic character study tells the story of a woman (Celia Rowlson-Hall) who looks back 20 years to a vacation that her perky 11-year-old self (Frankie Corio) took with her young and loving but quietly troubled father (Paul Mescal). In doing so, it explores the subjects of memory, parent-child relationships, mental and emotional well-being, and the various senses of loss we all experience over time, topics that the protagonist's youthful counterpart may not have fully understood at the time but that her adult self now does. I wish I could say the same for myself, though; I often felt that I was being tasked to construct a narrative for the picture myself, based, essentially, on merely what was being shown to me, material that frequently comes across as underdeveloped and open to an array of interpretation in terms of both story line and character development. To put it simply, I didn't feel I was given enough substance to work with to accomplish that task, and it often left me feeling wanting, abandoned by the filmmaker, and, ultimately, uninterested. And, to complicate matters further, the film's poor sound quality regularly obscures the characters' dialogue behind their thick Scottish accents, and its often-dark, overly muddled cinematography made some images difficult to decipher at times. What's more, this offering's camera work - aimed at simulating glorified home movies, a fitting approach for telling this story - is packed with innocuous material. Indeed, who really cares about sitting through endless footage of the characters engaging in mundane activities like playing video games, eating ice cream and attempting to sing karaoke? The ""looking back in fondness"" factor in these supposedly touching segments is a little too inane to engender truly heart-tugging feelings, constituting cinematic padding more than anything integral or meaningful to the overall story. Considering all of the advance glowing reactions I had read about this release, I was really looking forward to it going in. Unfortunately, though, I came away from it almost as sad and disappointed as the protagonist herself.","it's one thing for a movie to be subtle and nuanced, but it's something else entirely to be

"I'm always happy when I see debut feature's from new filmmakers, Charlotte Wells is the newest addition to that list. After Lynne Ramsay and Ruth Paxton, here we have another brilliant Scottish Filmmaker with her feature debut ""Aftersun"" produced by Barry Jenkins and Adele Romanski. The story revolves around Sophie and her father Calum, a divorcee who must care for his minor daughter while coping with loneliness and mental health.The film opens with a handy cam footage of Calum where at first glance seems almost happy, until he is posed to answer a question by Sophie. The frame is paused, followed by glitches from the footage as we follow in flashback. Eleven-year-old Sophie vacationing with her dad. It is full of light, happy moments they shared between each other but it always fades into bitterness till the last goodbye.Don't think this is is yet another traumatic arthouse film with ambiguous narrative that drags out and goes nowhere. I promise you that this plot is smart, will immerse you avidly, sometimes choking on what is happening on the screen. Because it is very difficult to resist drawing parallels with real life. Some might feel this is a personal story or the life story of your friends is woven into the film.Firstly, the issues raised in the film like the coming-of-age, loneliness are not blown out of proportion or doesn't scream too loud. Even with the chic and sophisticated staging, filters the father-daughter relationship doesn't fall into the stereotypes. The bond between both is shot so beautifully unlike Hollywood directors who strongly exaggerate. On the one hand, i love how the director uses the location to reveal the characters, exposing the emptiness and with famous musical accompanies as background score.Secondly, kudos for Charlotte Wells as she cleverly registers emotions though it is never explained in dialogues. In fact, very little is explained in this atmospheric film. I loved the staging of a particular scene, Sophie takes a small glance through the keyhole as she watches girl ""hand job"" gesture while she brags about it with her friends. So many things would have gone wrong here but i appreciate Wells for drawing a line and keeping things delicate throughout the runtime.Coming to the performances, Paul Mescal is capable of transmitting tenacity and great fragility in the same shot as he stares into the abyss and the internal conflicts that lie dormant deep within him (the dance scene). He gives his best to hold the viewer in an atmosphere of melancholy and empathy. There are times when he does his best as a Father and especially the bare back shot of him sobbing is brilliant without excessive melodrama as the scene cuts to a letter he had written to Sophie.Frankie Corio is magnificent in her first acting debut as a 11-year-old, it seems like this was the role she was destined to play, a tailored made character. She is not too matured, whimsical or cute with dramatic intensity but does strike a balance with emotions and inhabits the typical 11- year-old mentality with lot of curiosity (liked how director used the Hookah pot instead of dumb question to register innocence). She hangs out with Michael, they don't introduce in the first meeting, it happens the second time. For me this ranks in the list of my favourite Child performances along with Stanislaw Rózewicz's Birth Certificate (1961), Shinji Sômai's Moving (1993), Dorota Kedzierzawska's Crows (1994), Patricio Kaulen's A Long Journey (1967), Kjell Grede's Hugo and Josephine (1967), Amir Naderi's The Runner (1984), Mariana Rondón's Bad Hair (2013), Yared Zeleke's Lamb (2015), Achero Mañas's El Bola

To those who love slow burn drama, be prepared to sail along to the Sunny side of Turkey as Wells paints a portrait of life, Mental illness and Fatherhood, to say the least, centered on a arthouse narrative. I guarantee that this film's sensitivity and making will strike you at heart with the symmetry of its two protagonists alone .","i'm always happy when i see debut feature's from new filmmakers,

along to the sunny side of turkey as wells paints a portrait of life mental illness and fatherhood to say the least centered on a arthouse narrative i guarantee that this films sensitivity and making will strike you at heart with the symmetry of its two protagonists alone ,im always happy when i see debut features from new filmmakers charlotte wells is the newest addition to that list after lynne ramsay and ruth paxton here we have another brilliant scottish filmmaker with her feature debut aftersun produced by barry jenkins and adele romanski the story revolves around sophie and her father calum a divorcee who must care for his minor daughter while coping with loneliness and mental healththe film opens with a handy cam footage of calum where at first glance seems almost happy until he is posed to answer a question by sophie the frame is paused followed by glitches from the footage as we follow in flashback elevenyearold sophie vacationing with her dad it is full of light happy moments they shared between each other but it always fades into bitterness till the last goodbyedont think this is is yet another traumatic arthouse film with ambiguous narrative that drags out and goes nowhere i promise you that this plot is smart will immerse you avidly sometimes choking on what is happening on the screen because it is very difficult to resist drawing parallels with real life some might feel this is a personal story or the life story of your friends is woven into the filmfirstly the issues raised in the film like the comingofage loneliness are not blown out of proportion or doesnt scream too loud even with the chic and sophisticated staging filters the fatherdaughter relationship doesnt fall into the stereotypes the bond between both is shot so beautifully unlike hollywood directors who strongly exaggerate on the one hand i love how the director uses the location to reveal the characters exposing the emptiness and with famous musical accompanies as background scoresecondly kudos for charlotte wells as she cleverly registers emotions though it is never explained in dialogues in fact very little is explained in this atmospheric film i loved the staging of a particular scene sophie takes a small glance through the keyhole as she watches girl hand job gesture while she brags about it with her friends so many things would have gone wrong here but i appreciate wells for drawing a line and keeping things delicate throughout the runtimecoming to the performances paul mescal is capable of transmitting tenacity and great fragility in the same shot as he stares into the abyss and the internal conflicts that lie dormant deep within him the dance scene he gives his best to hold the viewer in an atmosphere of melancholy and empathy there are times when he does his best as a father and especially the bare back shot of him sobbing is brilliant without excessive melodrama as the scene cuts to a letter he had written to sophiefrankie corio is

"I will go against the tide with AFTERSUN and say I don't think it's a great movie. Written and directed by Sophie Wells, AFTERSUN tells the story of Sophie (Frankie Corio) reflecting on a summer holiday with her father (Calum, played by Paul Mescal) 20 years before. She reflects on a few key moments from the holiday while trying to reconcile the difference between her father when she was 12 years old and the father she has come to know since.The story is told partially through flashbacks and is primarily set in summertime, which gives the film a dreamy, nostalgic atmosphere. The cinematography captures the beauty of Turkey's landscapes with its sun-drenched beaches and vibrant colours. It's easy to feel immersed in Sophie's world as she reflects on her father, who was suffering from deep depression, which she was unaware of.Unfortunately, AFTERSUN fails to deliver a compelling story. The film's slow pace and lack of character development make it hard to connect with the characters. We don't get much insight into Sophie's life before or after her father, making it difficult to feel emotionally invested in their relationship.The dialogue is often stilted and awkward, which I attribute to Wells's inexperience as a writer-director. She also relies too heavily on flashbacks which become tedious after a while due to the lack of depth in the characters.AFTERSUN also suffers from a lack of narrative drive. There are no real stakes or tension in the story, which is essential for any drama to be successful. The film meanders through Sophie's memories without really going anywhere and eventually ends with an abrupt and unsatisfying resolution.The performances from Corio and Mescal are adequate but don't quite make up for the shortcomings in the script. Corio can capture Sophie's innocence and confusion as she reflects on her father's past. Mescal can also bring a sense of sadness and regret to the role, which helps make the relationship between Sophie and her father more believable.Overall, AFTERSUN falls short of being a compelling drama. It lacks narrative drive and character development and fails to tug at our heartstrings meaningfully. While it may have its moments of beauty, it doesn't quite make up for the lacklustre storytelling or overall experience.","i will go against the tide with aftersun and say i don't think it's a great

"A teenage girl (Sophie) and her father (Calum) journey to a seaside resort in Turkey for a brief but momentous vacation. Since her parents are separated and she lives with her mother, Sophie rarely gets such an opportunity to spend time with her dad. As they swim and snorkel together, share meals and a room, and talk about important things in life, the two begin to truly bond. Happy and cherished memories are formed, yet problems such as depression, alcoholism, and doubt surface as well. Sophie and Calum attempt to ride the waves that lift them up but just as easily take them under.Aftersun is an intimate and moving portrait of a father and daughter relationship that, according to the director who was at this Toronto International Film Festival screening, is loosely based on real people and her own life. The camera work is intentionally unsteady and from the point of view of Sophie. The filming technique is meant to evoke the sensation of Sophie looking back on treasured memories as if they were in a picture show. There are occasional jumps forward in time of adult Sophie reflecting on what these memories mean to her. The personalities of the characters are gradually revealed so the audience has a chance to meditate on who they are.Aftersun is the feature debut for Charlotte Wells. It is deeply personal for her. It first appeared in Cannes. There is a tremendously moving dance sequence that alone is worth watching the entire film. While the mechanics of Aftersun (the acting, images, story construction, etc.) are more than sound, it really rises above the ordinary and is so stirring because of its central themes; how we shape the memories that we hold and the important things we wish to say to those we love but often don't get a chance to say. ""Live wherever you want and be whoever you want,"" Calum tells Sophie.

"There are a lot of people here that got emotional watching it. This movie touched their souls. Out of respect for them, i will be very careful as i write my review.I didn't connect with these characters. If i were a woman, or had a daughter, maybe i would empathize more. But i wouldn't bet on this because, generally, i don't need to connect in a personal level with the characters in order to enjoy a movie. I felt in distance because i couldn't understand what i was watching. There were no hints during the first hour that something is wrong. So, what was the point in watching a father and a daughter on their vacations? It was totally uninteresting. I watched it until the ending because acting was great, both Mescal and Corio were excellent. I was waiting for something to happen, and when it did happen, too little, too late. Last 20-25 minutes were more intense, for sure. But still, i couldn't understand the ending. I was searching in the web for an interpretation, what was the meaning of this? At some point, i thought about a different outcome, i thought that the father was a bad person. But, i got it wrong as it seems.There are some good scenes here. When the father and the daughter were dancing under the sound of David Bowie in the end, it was a sad and beautiful scene, especially when you listen to this particular song's lyrics. Chemistry was great, i really felt their love for each other.Subtlety is great when the director is skillful. But never go full subtle. This is a movie, not a poem. A certain level of connection with the events and the characters, is necessary. I love poetic/dream like/art movies. But in this case, i need a strong imagery, deep meanings, substance over style, beautiful cinematography etc. This movie didn't provide me anything of that.I hope i didn't offend anyone. I really don't care about downvoting but this movie's theme made me chose carefully my words because i respect what this movie mean to some people.","there are a lot of people here that got emotional

because i respect what this movie mean to some people,there are a lot of people here that got emotional watching it this movie touched their souls out of respect for them i will be very careful as i write my reviewi didnt connect with these characters if i were a woman or had a daughter maybe i would empathize more but i wouldnt bet on this because generally i dont need to connect in a personal level with the characters in order to enjoy a movie i felt in distance because i couldnt understand what i was watching there were no hints during the first hour that something is wrong so what was the point in watching a father and a daughter on their vacations it was totally uninteresting i watched it until the ending because acting was great both mescal and corio were excellent i was waiting for something to happen and when it did happen too little too late last 2025 minutes were more intense for sure but still i couldnt understand the ending i was searching in the web for an interpretation what was the meaning of this at some point i thought about a different outcome i thought that the father was a bad person but i got it wrong as it seemsthere are some good scenes here

"AFTERSUN (A) is a quietly devastating British drama from first-time director Charlotte Wells that demonstrates an understanding of cinema you rarely see even in experienced hands. The film is framed by an older Sophie reminiscing about a vacation she took with her father Calum (it's his 32nd birthday) to Turkey by watching footage of it taken on a small camcorder. The film spends most of the runtime observing the daily activities Sophie and Calum on their vacation at a cheap Turkish resort. While there is largely no driving conflict in these sequences, they certainly aren't boring. The director Wells and cinematographer Gregory Oke have found ways to fill every frame with clues, hints, and heartbreaking details about our two characters and the different struggles going on in their lives that aren't apparent in their daily routines. We learn that Sophie is coming of age and trying to make sense of her relationship to her father and to other boys. Where a film like Spielberg's The Fabelmans gives a very glossy/old school Hollywood vibe to his coming of age moments, Aftersun is willing to let its audience sit back, observe our characters and their interactions, and come to their own conclusions. Both films deal with disenchantment with parents and the mystery of the future, but I think Aftersun's passive vibe is much more effective in creating a reflective melancholy - at least I relate to it more anyways. We also learn that not everything is okay with Calum either. What exactly it is, I will leave to you to discover. By the time the film comes to its closing act, an observant viewer will have pieced many of the film's strands together in a way that the final sequences of the holiday and film not only confirm your sneaking suspicions, but an emotional wallop that few films truly earn. It's not cheap sentimentality nor is it a soaring score that left me teared up long after the credits - it's that the revelation that the film quietly about something else the entire time. Aftersun is a masterpiece in speaking volumes while saying little. It's not a film about answers or solutions, but an observation on memory, time, regrets, and our parents - especially our parents. About how their love can be felt despite their faults and despite the sufferings we never knew about.","aftersun (a) is a quietly devastating british drama from first-time director charlotte wells

"SummaryThe director Charlotte Wells offers us a morose autobiographical story where point of view, subtlety and dead times combine against her intention to convey the protagonist's nostalgia for a lost father and paradise and the inevitability of not having understood him on time. A film where the tensions between child and adult perspectives, between naivety and understanding, between experience and loss are only latent.ReviewA woman recalls vacationing with her father at a Turkish spa when she was 11 years old.Aftersun is an unfortunate conjunction of four topics widely covered by fiction: the autobiographical, the point of view, the subtlety and dead times.When a creator or creator faces a story with autobiographical elements, there is always the risk of falling into narcissism, when the memories invoked and especially the way of exposing them, are only interesting for the one who writes or films them and the nostalgia they generate is not produce resonance with the reader/spectator. Not everyone is Annie Ernaux, Elena Ferrante or Woody Allen or Steven Spielberg or even Joanna Hogg, to go to a more related style. And Charlotte Wells clearly isn't.With respect to the point of view, the director and screenwriter of this debut film narrates from the perpective of an adult who rescues her memories as a child, but maintaining a nostalgic and cut-out look as a child and perhaps filling in some gaps related to the reality of a loving father, very young but hiding a malaise and whom he had not seen for a long time; a discomfort that does not take long to emerge on the surface of a placid coexistence. These tensions between child and adult perspectives, between naivety and understanding, between experience and loss can always be interesting. But this is not the case. Perhaps the strobe lights of the adult Sophie dancing represent that fragmented rescue of the past where tensions do not consolidate. Aftersun. A succession of vignettes about a more or less placid everyday life is not enough (such as applying sunscreen or post-sunscreen, the Aftersun of the title).And it is the point of view and the self-imposed clipping that are also linked to subtlety and idle times. There are innumerable examples of subtle stories with dead times, but at the same time powerful. But this is not the case. The succession of placid vignettes of that stay in the hotel in the 90s, seasoned with the inevitable home videos, try to rescue a lost paradise with weak ominous shadows that immerse the viewer in a slow and at times frankly soporific story.Frankie Corio naturally composes a charming girl Sophie and Paul Mescal (the handsome beach attendant in The Dark Daughter) at 26 perhaps looks too young for the young father who nevertheless composes sensitively.","summarythe director charlotte wells offers us a morose autobiographical story where point of view, subtlety and dead times combine against her

"I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience.

"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?","pros: 1. for the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. this film definitely serves as a love letter from james cameron (director) to the ocean.2. there are some touching scenes when it came to jake (sam worthington) and neytiri (zoe saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. there are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. the strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.cons: 1. plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous na'vi's.2. the run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour

"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game.

"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.","this sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. while the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as

"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.","it's a james cameron film, so it's impressive. the special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. but avatar: the way of water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. in fact, the story of the way of water is almost identical to the first avatar. instead of humans learning to be na'vi and then fighting stephen slang, a family of forest na'vi learns to be ocean na'vi and then fight stephen lang. all the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. it really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first avatar, that's all it is.",its a james cameron film so its impressive the special effects camerawork worldbuilding and action were all off the charts but avatar the way of water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments in fact the story of the way of water is almost identical to the first avatar instead of humans learning to be navi and then fighting stephen slang a family of forest navi learns to be ocean navi and then fight stephen lang all the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one with the bonus of being compared to the original it really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece but just like the first avatar thats all it is,its a james cameron film so its impressive the special effects camerawork worldbuilding and action were all off the charts but avatar the way of water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments in fact the story of the way of water is almost identical to the first avatar instead of humans learning to be navi and then fighting stephen slang a family of forest navi learns to be ocean navi and then fight stephen lang all the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one with the bonus of being compared to the original it really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece but just like the first avatar thats all it is,james cameron film impressive special effects camerawork worldbuilding action charts avatar way water struggles like predecessor story character development departments fact story way water almost identical first avatar instead humans learning navi fighting stephen slang family forest navi learns ocean navi fight stephen lang strengths weaknesses first movie back one bonus compared original really visual feast special effects masterpiece like first avatar thats,james cameron film impressive special effects camerawork worldbuilding action charts altar way water struggles like predecessor story character development departments fact story way water almost identical first altar instead humans learning navy fighting stephen slang family forest navy learns ocean navy fight stephen long strength weaknesses first movie back one bonus compared original really visual feast special effects masterpiece like first altar that,"['james', 'cameron', 'film', 'impressive', 'special', 'effects', 'camerawork', 'worldbuilding', 'action', 'charts', 'altar', 'way', 'water', 'struggles', 'like', 'predecessor', 'story', 'character', 'development', 'departments', 'fact', 'story', 'way', 'water', 'almost', 'identical', 'first', 'altar', 'instead', 'humans', 'learning', 'navy', 'fighting', 'stephen', 'slang', 'family', 'forest', 'navy', 'learns', 'ocean', 'navy', 'fight', 'stephen', 'long', 'strength', 'weaknesses', 'first', 'movie', 'back', 'one', 'bonus', 'compared', 'original', 'really', 'visual', 'feast', 'special', 'effects', 'masterpiece', 'like', 'first', 'altar', 'that']",jame cameron film impress special effect camerawork worldbuild action chart altar way water struggl like predecessor stori charact develop depart fact stori way water almost ident first altar instead human learn navi fight stephen slang famili forest navi learn ocean navi fight stephen long strength weak first movi back one bonu compar origin realli visual feast special effect masterpiec like first altar that,jame cameron film impress special effect camerawork worldbuild action chart altar way water struggl like predecessor stori charact develop depart fact stori way water almost ident first altar instead human learn navi fight stephen slang famili forest navi learn ocean navi fight stephen long strength weak first movi back one bonu compar origin realli visual feast special effect masterpiec like first altar that
"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?","so, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable

At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah!

"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.","james cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.we start with a

people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. in the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.is it all bad? no. avatar 2 looks amazing. the action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. but that's all there is. it's empty beauty with no substance at all. and to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",james cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year avatar 2 is nothing but empty beautywe start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration jake is a happy dude and hes made some kids somehow none of this is explained well because apparently it doesnt matter people are here again and theyre evil again for reasons jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that its probably being destroyed but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe jake doesnt his son is touching a whale he shouldnt touch so thats way more interesting for some reason humanity sends miles clone after jake spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop jake from creating an uprising which has already succeeded jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down stillfor a three hour movie avatar 2 feels rushed quite often subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt were supposed to get attached to jakes new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over even by his own father its very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because theyre all shallow husks dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than come on bro we gotta do this bro its for family bro the overuse of bro is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to subzero levels none of the interactions feel natural spider as a character is the epitome of this he is not only horribly cast but added

"Movie exceeds all the CGI anyone can possibly expect, but the storyline fails to overwhelm the audience. Id say 70% of the film is about family bonding and descriptions of culture on Pandora.

But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go.

"There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest.

Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end.

"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it.

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them.

"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.","avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster avatar, directed by james cameron and starring sam worthington as jake sully, a former marine who becomes one

"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.","i should preface this by saying i'm a huge james cameron fan. t2, titanic, and avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of

"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find

I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,i saw the first one which was fantastic. i wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. the cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. one couple left part way though.it became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. the really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.now i'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. it's making me question my trust in imdb.,i saw the first one which was fantastic i wasnt sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk the cinema room had about 5 of seats occupied for the film one couple left part way thoughit became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parentssomething that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animationsfight scenes created some excitement but didnt lift the film out of the muddy waters the really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watchnow im wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real its making me question my trust in imdb,i saw the first one which was fantastic i wasnt sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk the cinema room had about 5 of seats occupied for the film one couple left part way thoughit became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parentssomething that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animationsfight scenes created some excitement but didnt lift the film out of the muddy waters the really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watchnow im wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real its making me question my trust in imdb,saw first one fantastic wasnt sure expect given mix ratings took risk cinema room 5 seats occupied film one couple left part way thoughit became clearer film based characters dialogue target audience young teens parentssomething applauded creativity wildlife animationsfight scenes created excitement didnt lift film muddy waters really dull plot spoilt film made tiresome watchnow im wondering many 9 10 star ratings real making question trust imdb,saw first one fantastic want sure expect given mix rating took risk cinema room 5 seats occupied film one couple left part way thought became clearer film based characters dialogue target audience young tens parentssomething applause creativity wildlife animationsfight scenes created excitement didn lift film muddy waters really dull plot spoils film made tiresome watchdog in wondering many 9 10 star rating real making question trust limb,"['saw', 'first', 'one', 'fantastic', 'want', 'sure', 'expect', 'given', 'mix', 'rating', 'took', 'risk', 'cinema', 'room', '5', 'seats', 'occupied', 'film', 'one', 'couple', 'left', 'part', 'way', 'thought', 'became', 'clearer', 'film', 'based', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'target', 'audience', 'young', 'tens', 'parentssomething', 'applause', 'creativity', 'wildlife', 'animationsfight', 'scenes', 'created', 'excitement', 'didn', 'lift', 'film', 'muddy', 'waters', 'really', 'dull', 'plot', 'spoils', 'film', 'made', 'tiresome', 'watchdog', 'in', 'wondering', 'many', '9', '10', 'star', 'rating', 'real', 'making', 'question', 'trust', 'limb']",saw first one fantast want sure expect given mix rate took risk cinema room 5 seat occupi film one coupl left part way thought becam clearer film base charact dialogu target audienc young ten parentssometh applaus creativ wildlif animationsfight scene creat excit didn lift film muddi water realli dull plot spoil film made tiresom watchdog in wonder mani 9 10 star rate real make question trust limb,saw first one fantast want sure expect given mix rate took risk cinema room 5 seat occupi film one coupl left part way thought becam clearer film base charact dialogu target audienc young ten parentssometh applaus creativ wildlif animationsfight scene creat excit didn lift film muddi water realli dull plot spoil film made tiresom watchdog in wonder mani 9 10 star rate real make question trust limb
"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...","without question, this has the best cg works i have seen in recent movies.. visuals are outstanding.. underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. and that's all to it.. just because it's a visual masterpiece, i cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. it felt like watching some episode from national geographic or animal planet..overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. first half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. i was like ,""okay.. i get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. now, please move on to the storyline.."".. climax fight portion was good but not as great as the avatar 2009 climax fight.. after the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes..

"Avatar 2 had a lot of anticipation after its long production process, but unfortunately, it fell short of expectations. Despite the impressive visuals and technological advancements, it felt like a missed opportunity to explore new territories. The storyline seemed eerily reminiscent of the first movie, with a recycled plot featuring the same tropes: the sacred tree, befriending creatures, learning languages, and the climactic battle. It's disappointing that such a lengthy development time and massive budget didn't result in a more innovative and original narrative. Hollywood should definitely strive for more creative storytelling that justifies both the time invested and the financial resources used.","avatar 2 had a lot of anticipation after its long production process, but unfortunately, it fell short of expectations. despite the impressive visuals and technological advancements, it felt like a missed opportunity to explore new territories. the storyline seemed eerily reminiscent of the first movie, with a recycled plot featuring the same tropes: the sacred tree, befriending creatures, learning languages, and the climactic battle. it's disappointing that such a lengthy development time and massive budget didn't result in a more innovative and original narrative. hollywood should definitely strive for more creative storytelling that justifies both the time invested and the financial resources used.",avatar 2 had a lot of anticipation after its long production process but unfortunately it fell short of expectations despite the impressive visuals and technological advancements it felt like a missed opportunity to explore new territories the storyline seemed eerily reminiscent of the first movie with a recycled plot featuring the same tropes the sacred tree befriending creatures learning languages and the climactic battle its disappointing that such a lengthy development time and massive budget didnt result in a more innovative and original narrative hollywood should definitely strive for more creative storytelling that justifies both the time invested and the financial resources used,avatar 2 had a lot of anticipation after its long production process but unfortunately it fell short of expectations despite the impressive visuals and technological advancements it felt like a missed opportunity to explore new territories the storyline seemed eerily reminiscent of the first movie with a recycled plot featuring the same tropes the sacred tree befriending creatures learning languages and the climactic battle its disappointing that such a lengthy development time and massive budget didnt result in a more innovative and original narrative hollywood should definitely strive for more creative storytelling that justifies both the time invested and the financial resources used,avatar 2 lot anticipation long production process unfortunately fell short expectations despite impressive visuals technological advancements felt like missed opportunity explore new territories storyline seemed eerily reminiscent first movie recycled plot featuring tropes sacred tree befriending creatures learning languages climactic battle disappointing lengthy development time massive budget didnt result innovative original narrative hollywood definitely strive creative storytelling justifies time invested financial resources used,altar 2 lot anticipation long production process unfortunately fell short expectations despite impressive visual technological advancement felt like missed opportunity explore new territories storyline seemed verily reminiscence first movie recycle plot fearing ropes sacred tree befriending creatures learning languages climactic battle disappointing lengthy development time massive budget didn result innovative original narrative hollywood definitely strive creative storytelling justified time invested financial resources used,"['altar', '2', 'lot', 'anticipation', 'long', 'production', 'process', 'unfortunately', 'fell', 'short', 'expectations', 'despite', 'impressive', 'visual', 'technological', 'advancement', 'felt', 'like', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'explore', 'new', 'territories', 'storyline', 'seemed', 'verily', 'reminiscence', 'first', 'movie', 'recycle', 'plot', 'fearing', 'ropes', 'sacred', 'tree', 'befriending', 'creatures', 'learning', 'languages', 'climactic', 'battle', 'disappointing', 'lengthy', 'development', 'time', 'massive', 'budget', 'didn', 'result', 'innovative', 'original', 'narrative', 'hollywood', 'definitely', 'strive', 'creative', 'storytelling', 'justified', 'time', 'invested', 'financial', 'resources', 'used']",altar 2 lot anticip long product process unfortun fell short expect despit impress visual technolog advanc felt like miss opportun explor new territori storylin seem verili reminisc first movi recycl plot fear rope sacr tree befriend creatur learn languag climact battl disappoint lengthi develop time massiv budget didn result innov origin narr hollywood definit strive creativ storytel justifi time invest financi resourc use,altar 2 lot anticip long product process unfortun fell short expect despit impress visual technolog advanc felt like miss opportun explor new territori storylin seem verili reminisc first movi recycl plot fear rope sacr tree befriend creatur learn languag climact battl disappoint lengthi develop time massiv budget didn result innov origin narr hollywood definit strive creativ storytel justifi time invest financi resourc use
"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","it's hard to believe the sequel to avatar has actually come out. after 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays,

ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that avatar 2's clearly been given. as such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. the 3d is great (not something i'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.story-wise, i'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. if anything, james cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of aliens and terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen titanic, the abyss, or even terminator (1984).there's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. there are problems, but they barely matter. the strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. it just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",its hard to believe the sequel

"Avatar: The Way of Water, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking film Avatar, unfortunately falls short of expectations and feels like a disappointing rehash of its predecessor. Despite the immense success and innovative nature of the first film, this sequel fails to bring anything new to the table, making it a repetitive and unremarkable cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with The Way of Water is its lack of a fresh plot. Instead of expanding the universe established in the original film, the sequel merely retraces familiar territory. We find ourselves once again immersed in a conflict between the human colonizers and the indigenous Na'vi people, with themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes taking center stage. While these themes were impactful in the first movie, their repetition in the sequel feels uninspired and devoid of any originality.Furthermore, The Way of Water fails to deliver any significant advancements in visual effects. Considering the groundbreaking technology and breathtaking visuals that made the original Avatar so memorable, it's disheartening to witness the lack of progress in this area. The sequel seems content with replicating the same lush environments, vibrant colors, and awe-inspiring creatures, but without the same impact. It's as if the filmmakers relied on the success of the first film's visual appeal without pushing the boundaries further.Another major disappointment is the lack of character development. The new characters introduced in The Way of Water feel one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the depth and emotional connection that we witnessed with the original cast. Even the returning characters, while familiar, seem to be stuck in the same emotional arcs, further contributing to the feeling of déjà vu throughout the film.Despite its flaws, it's important to note that The Way of Water does maintain some technical proficiency. The action sequences are competently executed, and there are a few visually stunning moments that capture the beauty of Pandora. However, these fleeting moments of brilliance are not enough to salvage the overall lackluster experience.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. With a repetitive plot, a lack of innovative visual effects, and stagnant character development, the film feels like a mere copy of the first movie. Fans of the original might find some enjoyment in revisiting the world of Pandora, but for those seeking new and exciting storytelling, The Way of Water falls disappointingly short.","avatar: the way

The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down.

"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing.","i really wish i could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting

"'Avatar: The Way of Water' is the long gestating sequel to the mammoth hit from 2009 'Avatar', also directed by James Cameron. If this teaches us anything it is that more than likely you shouldn't bet against James Cameron as his high profile sequel soared to $1 billion dollars worldwide in only 14 days and, when all is said and done, will probably be one of only a handful of films to make over $2 billion. Despite a 13 year hiatus all of the principle actors return to reprise their roles including Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang and Sigourney Weaver. The film is a technical marvel and much of the delay was due to the need to actually develop the appropriate technology to allow filming Cameron's meticulous vision. At least one more Avatar film will be produced with the potential for more if they keep being successful.It is 12 years after the events of the first film and Jake Sully is the chief of his clan and lives with his wife Neytiri and their 3 children plus the adopted daughter of Grace's comatose avatar who's conception is a mystery. The daughter, Kiri, is also played by Sigourney Weaver who played Grace in the previous film. Another constant presence is a human boy called Spider who is a child of the deceased Miles Quaritch. The kid was too young to be put in cryostasis at the time most of the humans were expelled, and thus was allowed to stay growing up wild and much more Na'vi than human. Spider is, of course, practically inseparable from Sully's kids so you can see the potential for drama here. The ""Sky People"" as they are called have returned with the aim now being to colonize rather than plunder as the Earth is dying. The Sky People once again return with avatars of their own but this time instead of transferring a live human's consciousness into the avatar they were able to upload the thoughts and memories of deceased soldiers including the major antagonist from the first film Quaritch who serves as this avatar contingent's leader. On a raid Quaritch's avatars manage to capture Jake's kids including Spider. All of the kids are liberated except Spider who ends up begrudgingly aiding Quaritch. There is some sort of father son bonding that does occur, however, Spider remains predominantly loyal to his adopted Na'vi family. Jake Sully decides the best thing for the tribe is for him to take his family and flee. They eventually land with the reef people and need to learn the way of water to live there and be of use. There are growing pains for the family as they attempt to learn the ways of the new tribe. The children especially struggle as they don't fit in with the other kids. Of course Quaritch does not just let Sully and his family run and eventually tracks them to the reef people and begins a shock and awe campaign of violence to flush them out. The kids get captured again, and eventually a big showdown occurs, and of course with Cameron it is a spectacle of a showdown and while the side of right prevails, as one would expect, they do clearly leave room for the story to continue on.Cameron has clearly created a sumptuous visual feast with motion capture technology at the most cutting edge that it has every been, and I don't want to undersell the special effects as those special effects are why people are tuning in. It is why people are spending top dollar on premium seats at the best screens they can find because, story aside, this film demands to be seen in that format. Much like the first film 'The Way of Water' feels like all of the creative effort was put into the technical aspect of the film and the story is, for the most part, basic. In fact there are many very similar themes to the first story. As Jake initially needed to gain the trust of the forest people and bond with their mounts the family goes through the exact same trials when they get to the reef people. This film actually may take a step backwards with the plot due to some gaping plot holes that they just plow through with all their fancy effects hoping nobody is paying too close attention to things like the narrative. It is an incredibly bizarre shift that in the first film the human invaders were looking for the universe's most expensive mineral, and only 12 years later the Earth is dying so now finding a new home is the mission du jour. Somewhere in there they just managed to uncover a completely different substance that everybody is after, and there is no mention of the unobtanium that drove the entire plot of the first film. The other huge flaw is the main driver for this film which is Quaritch's pursuit of Jake Sully which seems very much like a vendetta from his past life although it is not framed that way. The story only casually mentions why so many resources are being exhausted to hunt down this former chieftain. The script does not make it clear whether or not the Sky People seek to inhabit Pandora along with the Na'vi or if the are seeking to destroy them or pacify them. I think ultimately the aim, for now, is pacification and they believe getting Jake Sully will somehow accomplish that although once his family goes into exile that makes zero sense. It is super frustrating to see such an impressive display and see the narrative squandered. I will give James Cameron all the credit in the world as he has made a movie that everyone believes needs to be seen in theaters on the big screen, and I agree with that sentiment. Due to the visual effects alone this is a special film, however, these films of his are never going to be great until he can really develop the narrative beyond these basic confines he has lain out while also making the story actually make sense with in the larger framework of the film. As with the first movie 'Avatar: The Way of Water' is a beautiful yet flawed ideal.Eric's Grade: B-","'avatar: the way of water' is the long gestating sequel to the mammoth hit from 2009 'avatar',

sully and his family run and eventually tracks them to the reef people and begins a shock and awe campaign of violence to flush them out the kids get captured again and eventually a big showdown occurs and of course with cameron it is a spectacle of a showdown and while the side of right prevails as one would expect they do clearly leave room for the story to continue oncameron has clearly created a sumptuous visual feast with motion capture technology at the most cutting edge that it has every been and i dont want to undersell the special effects as those special effects are why people are tuning in it is why people are spending top dollar on premium seats at the best screens they can find because story aside this film demands to be seen in that format much like the first film the way of water feels like all of the creative effort was put into the technical aspect of the film and the story is for the most part basic in fact there are many very similar themes to the first story as jake initially needed to gain the trust of the forest people and bond with their mounts the family goes through the exact same trials when they get to the reef people this film actually may take a step backwards with the plot due to some gaping plot holes that they just plow through with all their fancy effects hoping nobody is paying too close attention to things like the narrative it is an incredibly bizarre shift that in the first film the human invaders were looking for the universes most expensive mineral and only 12 years later the earth is dying so now finding a new home is the mission du jour somewhere in there they just managed to uncover a completely different substance that everybody is after and there is no mention of the unobtanium that drove the entire plot of the first film the other huge flaw is the main driver for this film which is quaritchs pursuit of jake sully which seems very much like a vendetta from his past life although it is not framed that way the story only casually mentions why so many resources are being exhausted to hunt down this former chieftain the script does not make it clear whether or not the sky people seek to inhabit pandora along with the navi or if the are seeking to destroy them or pacify them i think ultimately the aim for now is pacification and they believe getting jake sully will somehow accomplish that although once his family goes into exile that makes zero sense it is super frustrating to see such an impressive display and see the narrative squandered i will give james cameron all the credit in the world as he has made a movie that everyone believes needs to be seen in theaters on the big screen and i agree with that sentiment due to the visual effects alone this is a special film however these films of his are never going to be great until he can really develop the narrative beyond these basic confines he has lain out while also making the story actually make sense with in the larger framework of the film as with the first movie avatar the way of water is a beautiful yet flawed idealerics grade b,avatar the way of water is the long gestating sequel to the mammoth hit from 2009 avatar also directed by james cameron if this teaches us anything it is that more than likely you shouldnt bet against james cameron as his high profile sequel soared to 1 billion dollars worldwide in only 14 days and when all is said and done will probably be one of only a handful of films to make over 2 billion despite a 13 year hiatus all of the principle actors return to reprise their roles including sam worthington zoe saldana stephen lang and sigourney weaver the film is a technical marvel and much of the delay was due to the need to actually develop the appropriate technology to allow filming camerons meticulous vision at least one more avatar film will be produced with the potential for more if they keep being successfulit is 12 years after the events of the first film and jake sully is the chief of his clan and lives with his wife neytiri and their 3 children plus the adopted daughter of graces comatose avatar whos conception is a mystery the daughter kiri is also played by sigourney weaver who played grace in the previous film another constant presence is a human boy called spider who is a child of the deceased miles quaritch the kid was too young to be put in cryostasis at the time most of the humans were expelled and thus was allowed to stay growing up wild and much more navi than human spider is of course practically inseparable from sullys kids so you can see the potential for drama here the sky people as they are called have returned with the aim now being to colonize rather than plunder as the earth is dying the sky people once again return with avatars of their own but this time instead of transferring a live humans consciousness into the avatar they were able to upload the thoughts and memories of deceased soldiers including the major antagonist from the first film quaritch who serves as this avatar contingents leader on a raid quaritchs avatars manage to capture jakes kids including spider all of the kids are liberated except spider who ends up begrudgingly aiding quaritch there is some sort of father son bonding that does occur however spider remains predominantly loyal to his adopted navi family jake sully decides the best thing for the

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.","one of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, oppenheimer largely

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.","""oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by christopher nolan (""the dark knight

physicist j robert oppenheimer cillian murphy is recruited by the united states government to oversee the manhattan project a top secret operation intended to develop the worlds first nuclear weapons after becoming acquainted with the projects director major general leslie groves matt damon oppenheimer and the general come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of los alamos new mexico as numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the nazis can devise their own with the war raging and personal troubles mounting oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits but soon suffers the consequences of his dedicationon august 6th 1945 the atomic bomb little boy was dropped on the japanese city of hiroshima making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war the dropping of this bomb and fat man in nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to world war ii and with it began a frightening new era known as the atomic age to this day it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it the one man whom most people pin all the blame on is j robert oppenheimer whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as the father of the atomic bomb a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life in christopher nolans biopic oppenheimer we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex mans legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades laterin true christopher nolan fashion the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented nonsequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subjects life when we are first introduced to j robert oppenheimer we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers even as a young student however almost immediately after the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him as the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life these scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people this gives the viewer a first person perspective of what oppenheimers mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials its hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion but nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect mananother notable thing about nolans direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes one moment which i wont speak about in too much detail literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last since nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using cgi in his movies he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs by reminding the audience that the nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game as each bomb explodes it can be likened to a ticking clock with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon the creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace something especially necessary considering the films three hour runtime nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017s dunkirk which utilised the films score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence once again nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using cg effects to tell a story and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiencyfor what can only be described as the performance of his career cillian murphy brings everything necessary to the role of j robert oppenheimer a man so complex that i cant imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively the combined efforts of both murphys acting and nolans direction help make oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century this is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an indepth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish the film paints oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books murphy approaches him like that of a shakespearian figure rife with flaws haughtiness and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate one scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family he can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history while consequently ushering in something even worsethe rest of the films cast all did a fantastic job as well with the standouts being matt damon robert downey jr emily blunt and florence pugh damons take on major general leslie groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use oppenheimers talents to his advantage we watch as groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power grovess ignorance to oppenheimers extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail to that effect he provides an important third party perspective to oppenheimers achievementsits also great to see robert downey jr shine as lewis strauss which is not only his best postmcu role but one of his best roles in general strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing oppenheimers ties to communism he holds such a grudge against oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story downey takes every opportunity to show strausss twofaced nature biding his time for the right moment to strip oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation reportedly downey considers this his best role to date and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performanceemily blunt and florence pugh also contributed significantly as kitty oppenheimer and jean tatlock respectively each of these two women represent something significant in oppenheimers life with kitty being who he should be with and jean being who he personally wants to be with this draws parallels to that of oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities it can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making sometimes you have no other choiceas a biopic and a christopher nolan film oppenheimer exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields there are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through i guess sometimes all it takes is one brave risktaking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task we need more films like this to inspire thoughtful creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream after all its a tough job but someones got to do it for usi rate it a perfect 1010,oppenheimer is a biographical thriller

"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared!

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---At least 60% of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.","i was familiar with the manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.is it nolan's

"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.","i'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, cillian murphy might as well

"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it once already, and going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon.","oppenheimer might be the best film i watched in a long, long time.very different than nolan's recent films,

"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.","just came out of the theater and watching oppenheimer was such a great experience. i know many people will criticize the movie for some

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.","i'm a big nolan fan. maybe this one just wasn't for me.this movie was

couple of meetings he was involved in with oppenheimer its a political drama with not much drama there isnt enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it will oppenheimer lose his security clearance will strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing who cares if youre not invested in any of the characters why would you care about what happens to them in the endmaybe this is the best one can do with the source material maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting couldve told the story better maybe its time for nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matterunlike previous nolan movies i wont be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better theres just nothing else in therefor me this isnt one of his top movies technically its great the acting is also great the writing and editing just isnt therealso imax is great but not every movie benefits from it this one really didnt maybe if nolan wasnt so focused on the technical side hed be able to get me emotionally invested in this storyediti had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tensionthe imitation gamea movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war that topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the timethe tension is focused on the task of breaking the german code not on what will happen to the lead characters years later its a lot easier to be invested in that even though we know who won that war vs the results of some political hearing,im a big nolan fan maybe this one just wasnt for methis movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb we were told we should see it on the biggest screen go out of your way for an imax 70mm projection if you can or at least get a regular 70mm or laser imaxit turns out that while nolans visuals still look good in this movie theres nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats its like a 1 michelin star if your local theater has those formats might as well go for it but thats probably true for any movieit also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie the whole trailer is really just one scene i guess there wasnt a more interesting way to approach the los alamos part of the story what could he do focus on the scientific challenges not really the best source for a storywe get the review of oppenheimer for a security clearance which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships i guess because she was a

"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed.

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.","okay, nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what i'm about to say. that's the only way i can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted nolan fans inflating the score. because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. not in any sane universe.i've seen all of nolan's films. memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and the dark knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. but inception was a long slog of exposition, and interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.nolan likes to tackle big ideas. dreams and outer space. here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that oppenheimer offers kitty before marrying her. he explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.for the first two hours of oppenheimer, i was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. you are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. fission and 2. fusion.

score because if youre honest theres no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 89 not in any sane universeive seen all of nolans films memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and the dark knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing gritty and crackling with verisimilitude but inception was a long slog of exposition and interstellar while offering some good moments also imploded under the weight of the writerdirectors egonolan likes to tackle big ideas dreams and outer space here he delves into quantum physics but its relegated to a line really that oppenheimer offers kitty before marrying her he explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an attraction to one another and then they hold handsfor the first two hours of oppenheimer i was lost in a blizzard of short disparate scenes constant musical score actors chewing through endless dialog you are never allowed to rest never really sure where or when you are nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning 1 fission and 2 fusion or maybe it was the other way around he separates the time period of public hearing with robert downey jr as the main character by desaturating to black and white but other than the makeup used to age or deage cillian murphys oppenheimer you never really know quite where you are or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the storythere is the public hearing and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors and then there is some semblance of oppenheimers backstory  his love life his gradual involvement in government leading to a general matt damon for some reason hiring him to be the head of los alamos all of this is mashed together scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else something else often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding i assume thats supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work oppenheimer is doing his theorizing and contemplating but thats it for any demonstration of the actually work oppenheimer does save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear hes terrible in a labyet without exaggeration by an hour into the movie weve been told at least ten times that oppenheimer is brilliant or a genius were just never shown why and this is nolans chief sin  he is a teller not a shower a writer not really a directortake a beautiful mind for comparison in that movie director ron howard regularly visualizes the work of john nash he shows him for instance watching pigeons gather crumbs and in his minds eye he maps their pattern or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them film is a visual mediumconsider schindlers list or any spielberg movie really and observe the blocking of the actors the placement of the camera all in service of telling the story visually an actor may dominate the frame or maybe have his back turned characters may move and create an entirely new frame blocking their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the storyin nolans filmmaking where the camera goes is really arbitrary and where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene so that the editing feels off clunky the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction or coming back with an actor already in motion this is because nolan is cutting for the script relying on dialog to tell the entire story even plays have blockingtrue he decides to tell the story of the father of the abomb chiefly through these two hearings the public one and the closed one so theres going to be lots of talking but then he doubles down on the talking  on the telling  even further in one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer in some room somewhere i dont even know who affleck was playing really it was very short and while hes talking to oppenheimer nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with matt damon on a train with oppenheimer and damon is telling us about affleck and who he is and what he wantscharacter should be revealed through action not some other character explaining everything off to the sidethere are a great many cameos in nolans film  it is star studded but rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed they distract at one point a woman near me in the theater said oh look who that is when remi malek appeared were focused on the actor and their previous roles not the charactereverything in this movie especially the first ninety minutes bounced me off like a stone skipping over water the scenes are too short the music never stops there are too many characters were always changing time and place im not really sure whats happening famous faces keep popping up and i dont understand why everything is so franticonce we get to about the halfway mark and the trinity project gets that infamous test the movie sinks in a little thats because nolan finally slows things down lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment lets us be immersedafter that for the most part hes back a it whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating still i felt more in tune for the second half of the film because i could now sense the dilemma the emotional conflict in oppenheimer after hiroshima and nagasaki in one of the best scenes in the film oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the american empire but the room turns white and rumbles and womans skin flaysand finally another scene with emily blunt as kitty oppenheimer giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing really steals the show blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie though she had little screen timetheres not much else to say i feel like i just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that i thought i already knew but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling i didnt really learn anything new not about the physics of the abomb nor did i really get a sense of the mccarthyism of the era they were just after oppenheimer for no real reason i could grasp until very close to the end apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the hbombnolan tries a twist too holding back on a brief conversation between oppenheimer and

"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day. I'm endlessly sad that I have to wait another three years for a new Nolan movie, and hope that he switches back to something more intriguing than the life of a scientist.(1 viewing, opening Thursday

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.","at its core

"Is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... I hate to say it... boring?. I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that . I still give the movie an 8.","is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... i hate to say it... boring?. i know i know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but

"Anything that Nolan is involved in, I will go and see, the track record is enough to get me through the doors and on that seat.Oppenheimer represented something of a challenge to me the first time round, after a busy day at work, I went to see it, and at three hours long, after Barbie, it was too much, last night I watched it properly for the second time.As a casual viewer, it's a tough one, but if you're engaged and prepared, this is one outstanding movie. I am on no doubt whatsoever that this film will do very well in terms of awards, the whole cinema was totally immersed, the room was silent.The pacing builds as the film progresses, the second half was the best part, and I loved the ending.It gives some fascinating insight into the life and times of J. Robert Oppenheimer, most of which I knew nothing about, he's a genius, but like all of us, flawed.Cillian Murphy delivers an outstanding, award winning performance, his body language, his delivery, his sheer presence is sublime. Emily Blunt also stood out, she was terrific.I was happy to watch a second time, and no doubt, I'll gladly watch it on blu ray soon enough.9/10.","anything that nolan is involved in, i will go and

"Authentic audio-visual journey to the era of the birth of atomic genesis, which both terrifies and astonishes you with its nonlinear storytelling thanks to Christopher Nolan's masterful approach to direction and screenplay! The pacing of the movie is simply brilliant especially in the moments where the main theme by Ludwig Göransson kicks in! It's a future classic that will not leave you indifferent and will immerse you in the Homeric biography of the notorious scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer! Definitely a 10/10 for the artistic contribution to the history and art of audio-visual media depicting an extraordinarily important event for humanity and the present day!","authentic audio-visual journey to the era of the birth of atomic genesis, which both terrifies and astonishes you with its nonlinear storytelling thanks to christopher nolan's masterful approach to direction and screenplay! the pacing of the movie is simply brilliant especially in the moments where the main theme by ludwig göransson kicks in! it's a future classic that will not leave you indifferent and will immerse you in the homeric biography of the notorious scientist j. robert oppenheimer! definitely a 10/10 for the artistic contribution to the history and art of audio-visual media depicting an extraordinarily important event for humanity and the present day!",authentic audiovisual journey to the era of the birth of atomic genesis which both terrifies and astonishes you with its nonlinear storytelling thanks to christopher nolans masterful approach to direction and screenplay the pacing of the movie is simply brilliant especially in the moments where the main theme by ludwig göransson kicks in its a future classic that will not leave you indifferent and will immerse you in the homeric biography of the notorious scientist j robert oppenheimer definitely a 1010 for the artistic contribution to the history and art of audiovisual media depicting an extraordinarily important event for humanity and the present day,authentic audiovisual journey to the era of the birth of atomic genesis which both terrifies and astonishes you with its nonlinear storytelling thanks to christopher nolans masterful approach to direction and screenplay the pacing of the movie is simply brilliant especially in the moments where the main theme by ludwig g ransson kicks in its a future classic that will not leave you indifferent and will immerse you in the homeric biography of the notorious scientist j robert oppenheimer definitely a 1010 for the artistic contribution to the history and art of audiovisual media depicting an extraordinarily important event for humanity and the present day,authentic audiovisual journey era birth atomic genesis terrifies astonishes nonlinear storytelling thanks christopher nolans masterful approach direction screenplay pacing movie simply brilliant especially moments main theme ludwig göransson kicks future classic leave indifferent immerse homeric biography notorious scientist j robert oppenheimer definitely 1010 artistic contribution history art audiovisual media depicting extraordinarily important event humanity present day,authentic audiovisual journey era birth atomic genesis terrified astonished nonlinear storytelling thanks christopher plans wasteful approach direction screenplay pacing movie simply brilliant especially moments main theme ludwig grandson kicks future classic leave indifferent immense choleric biography notorious scientist j robert oppenheimer definitely 1010 artistic contribution history art audiovisual media depicting extraordinarily important event humanity present day,"['authentic', 'audiovisual', 'journey', 'era', 'birth', 'atomic', 'genesis', 'terrified', 'astonished', 'nonlinear', 'storytelling', 'thanks', 'christopher', 'plans', 'wasteful', 'approach', 'direction', 'screenplay', 'pacing', 'movie', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'especially', 'moments', 'main', 'theme', 'ludwig', 'grandson', 'kicks', 'future', 'classic', 'leave', 'indifferent', 'immense', 'choleric', 'biography', 'notorious', 'scientist', 'j', 'robert', 'oppenheimer', 'definitely', '1010', 'artistic', 'contribution', 'history', 'art', 'audiovisual', 'media', 'depicting', 'extraordinarily', 'important', 'event', 'humanity', 'present', 'day']",authent audiovisu journey era birth atom genesi terrifi astonish nonlinear storytel thank christoph plan wast approach direct screenplay pace movi simpli brilliant especi moment main theme ludwig grandson kick futur classic leav indiffer immens choler biographi notori scientist j robert oppenheim definit 1010 artist contribut histori art audiovisu media depict extraordinarili import event human present day,authent audiovisu journey era birth atom genesi terrifi astonish nonlinear storytel thank christoph plan wast approach direct screenplay pace movi simpli brilliant especi moment main theme ludwig grandson kick futur classic leav indiffer immens choler biographi notori scientist j robert oppenheim definit 1010 artist contribut histori art audiovisu medium depict extraordinarili import event human present day
"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in. It reminded me of Oliver Stone's JFK, which I love.","i just got out of oppenheimeri have started to worry about oppenheimer, as i have seen the trailer every time i have gone to the cinema. usually,

"Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad.","cillian murphy is exceptional in the lead role (oscar worthy,i'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see james remar again.the film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.however, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.the sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into imax.it's better than tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad.",cillian murphy is exceptional in the lead role oscar worthyill say and hes ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast great to see james remar againthe film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the never seen moment when its dropped on japan the sound and the nightmarish looks on peoples faces are horrifichowever at 3hrs its tedious talky and frankly rather boringthe sound is good but visually it didnt need to be made into imaxits better than tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad,cillian murphy is exceptional in the lead role oscar worthyill say and hes ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast great to see james remar againthe film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the never seen moment when its dropped on japan the sound and the nightmarish looks on peoples faces are horrifichowever at 3hrs its tedious talky and frankly rather boringthe sound is good but visually it didnt need to be made into imaxits better than tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad,cillian murphy exceptional lead role oscar worthyill say hes ably supported terrific ensemble cast great see james remar againthe film poses many moralistic questions bomb repercussions oppenheimer film works best especially never seen moment dropped japan sound nightmarish looks peoples faces horrifichowever 3hrs tedious talky frankly rather boringthe sound good visually didnt need made imaxits better tenet nice see mum dad,million murphy exceptional lead role oscar worthily say he ably supported terrific resemble cast great see james remark againthe film poses many moralistic questions bomb repercussions oppenheimer film works best especially never seen moment dropped japan sound nightmarish looks peoples faces horrifichowever his tedious talk frankly rather boringthe sound good usually didn need made maxims better tent nice see sum dad,"['million', 'murphy', 'exceptional', 'lead', 'role', 'oscar', 'worthily', 'say', 'he', 'ably', 'supported', 'terrific', 'resemble', 'cast', 'great', 'see', 'james', 'remark', 'againthe', 'film', 'poses', 'many', 'moralistic', 'questions', 'bomb', 'repercussions', 'oppenheimer', 'film', 'works', 'best', 'especially', 'never', 'seen', 'moment', 'dropped', 'japan', 'sound', 'nightmarish', 'looks', 'peoples', 'faces', 'horrifichowever', 'his', 'tedious', 'talk', 'frankly', 'rather', 'boringthe', 'sound', 'good', 'usually', 'didn', 'need', 'made', 'maxims', 'better', 'tent', 'nice', 'see', 'sum', 'dad']",million murphi except lead role oscar worthili say he abli support terrif resembl cast great see jame remark againth film pose mani moralist question bomb repercuss oppenheim film work best especi never seen moment drop japan sound nightmarish look peopl face horrifichowev hi tediou talk frankli rather boringth sound good usual didn need made maxim better tent nice see sum dad,million murphi except lead role oscar worthili say he abli support terrif resembl cast great see jame remark againth film pose mani moralist question bomb repercuss oppenheim film work best especi never seen moment drop japan sound nightmarish look peopl face horrifichowev hi tediou talk frankli rather boringth sound good usual didn need made maxim better tent nice see sum dad
"For every minute that passes during the 3-hour run time of the movie Oppenheimer, 1200 citizens in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki died. If you haven't got to see the movie it's worth pointing out that Oppenheimer - is not an anti nuclear movie. Nor is it a dramatic reconstruction of the devastating consequences of the use of the first nuclear bombs against the citizens of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. For this, you would be better advised to seek out the superior acclaimed BBC drama documentary Hiroshima (2005.)
That film graphically dramatised what it is like to live through a Nuclear attack, millisecond by horror filled millisecond.The Oppenheimer movie pretty much sidled past that part of the horror story.Oppenheimer is a well made biopic of a man, or to be more accurate - a ghoul. A man who wilfully, along with his Los Alamos buddies, messed round with plutonium, mined from thousands of uranium mines to build a weapon that would annihilate the civilian populations of two cities and possibly one day humanity.What's good: A fast paced immersive movie into the allegedly tortured mind of the director of the Manhattan Project J. Robert Oppenheimer. His team delivered a fission bomb to the US airforce at the cost of $2 billion dollars. The lead up to and the culmination of the Trinity Test contains the movie's strongest moments.What's bad: The story of the creation of the worst imaginable weapon and the consequences of its use is virtually skimmed over in favour of the McCarthy era security hearing of Oppenheimer in 1954, which resulted in his losing his 'security clearance.'
The hearing, the movie shows, was secretly instigated by Levi Strauss, the director of the post war Atomic Energy Commission. Strauss who had taken over the Manhattan project in 1946, never got on with Oppenheimer, who apposed the development of the hydrogen bomb.While it's an interesting story, it decidedly distracts from the real horror of what happened to the victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and descends - somewhat - into yet another attempt to justify the actions and subsequent hegemony of the United States. They even manage to name check JFK near the end for a little old fashioned jingoism.It's a good movie. But it would be timely for Netflix to stream When the Wind Blows (1986) and The Day After (1983) as well as the aforementioned BBC Hiroshima (2005)","for every minute that passes during the 3-hour run

"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.","i think i will be in the minority here when i say, i think christopher nolan missed the mark with this film. let's first talk about what worked: ""oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. i watched it in imax 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 dts-hd master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. the acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. i also don't think i need to say anything further about nolan as a filmmaker; he's like martin scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due. A 10 used to meant perfection, not just the glare or the sparkles. Remember not all that shines is gold.","it saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. first of all, a loud soundtrack. no matter how good it might be doesn't equate

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.","0 out of 10 starschristopher nolan's oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. the film is three hours long,

"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have. Part Two might tie everything together and make me enjoy Part One more in retrospect, but unfortunately, I left wanting more from this one.","man.... i wish i loved this movie more than i did. don't

"Just saw this one in a theatre, and boy... what an adrenaline rush it is. The latest Mission Impossible features some of the most incredible stunts ever put to camera. The story is absolutely exhilarating and continues to bring new life to a veteran movie franchise. The sheer scale of this movie is epic, and with every twist and turn of the movie, you cannot help but marvel at the incredible sets used to bring this movie to life. Such a movie begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible where you can truly feel the grandeur of the film. Tom Cruise has once again delivered one of the best movies of the year, and I cannot recommend that you see it enough!","just saw this one in a theatre, and boy... what an adrenaline rush it is. the latest mission impossible features some of the most incredible stunts ever put to camera. the story is absolutely exhilarating and continues to bring new life to a veteran movie franchise. the sheer scale of this movie is epic, and with every twist and turn of the movie, you cannot help but marvel at the incredible sets used to bring this movie to life. such a movie begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible where you can truly feel the grandeur of the film. tom cruise has once again delivered one of the best movies of the year, and i cannot recommend that you see it enough!",just saw this one in a theatre and boy what an adrenaline rush it is the latest mission impossible features some of the most incredible stunts ever put to camera the story is absolutely exhilarating and continues to bring new life to a veteran movie franchise the sheer scale of this movie is epic and with every twist and turn of the movie you cannot help but marvel at the incredible sets used to bring this movie to life such a movie begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible where you can truly feel the grandeur of the film tom cruise has once again delivered one of the best movies of the year and i cannot recommend that you see it enough,just saw this one in a theatre and boy what an adrenaline rush it is the latest mission impossible features some of the most incredible stunts ever put to camera the story is absolutely exhilarating and continues to bring new life to a veteran movie franchise the sheer scale of this movie is epic and with every twist and turn of the movie you cannot help but marvel at the incredible sets used to bring this movie to life such a movie begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible where you can truly feel the grandeur of the film tom cruise has once again delivered one of the best movies of the year and i cannot recommend that you see it enough,saw one theatre boy adrenaline rush latest mission impossible features incredible stunts ever put camera story absolutely exhilarating continues bring new life veteran movie franchise sheer scale movie epic every twist turn movie cannot help marvel incredible sets used bring movie life movie begs seen biggest screen possible truly feel grandeur film tom cruise delivered one best movies year cannot recommend see enough,saw one theatre boy adrenalin rush latest mission impossible features incredible sounds ever put camera story absolutely exhilarating continues bring new life veteran movie franchise sheer scale movie epic every twist turn movie cannot help marvel incredible sets used bring movie life movie legs seen biggest screen possible truly feel grandeur film tom cruise delivered one best moves year cannot recommend see enough,"['saw', 'one', 'theatre', 'boy', 'adrenalin', 'rush', 'latest', 'mission', 'impossible', 'features', 'incredible', 'sounds', 'ever', 'put', 'camera', 'story', 'absolutely', 'exhilarating', 'continues', 'bring', 'new', 'life', 'veteran', 'movie', 'franchise', 'sheer', 'scale', 'movie', 'epic', 'every', 'twist', 'turn', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'marvel', 'incredible', 'sets', 'used', 'bring', 'movie', 'life', 'movie', 'legs', 'seen', 'biggest', 'screen', 'possible', 'truly', 'feel', 'grandeur', 'film', 'tom', 'cruise', 'delivered', 'one', 'best', 'moves', 'year', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'see', 'enough']",saw one theatr boy adrenalin rush latest mission imposs featur incred sound ever put camera stori absolut exhilar continu bring new life veteran movi franchis sheer scale movi epic everi twist turn movi can not help marvel incred set use bring movi life movi leg seen biggest screen possibl truli feel grandeur film tom cruis deliv one best move year can not recommend see enough,saw one theatr boy adrenalin rush latest mission imposs featur incred sound ever put camera stori absolut exhilar continu bring new life veteran movi franchis sheer scale movi epic everi twist turn movi can not help marvel incred set use bring movi life movi leg seen biggest screen possibl truli feel grandeur film tom cruis deliv one best move year can not recommend see enough
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.","mission: impossible - dead

"Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*
""So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!""Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond? With the Bond girl cycling through every few films? Lazy writing. Not natural feeling. Forced. BlighIt pains me to give this so low.The truth is, this movie is mindless entertaining action. Tom Cruise delivers on some awesome stunts (seldom compared to other MI films). It's not horrible. It's fun entertainment, but a scour on the (in my opinion) reputable authentic feeling mission impossible series.","ethan hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!? Part two has some big shoes to fill!","this latest mission: impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. tom cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. in

"4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me. THAT has never happened to me before watching a MI movie!Despite this disappointing conclusion I still wanna thank you for reading my 2001 th review on Imdb.","4 considerations for those with high

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.","basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.definitely too loud, in fact. the music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.there are endless ridiculous fights in which tom cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. slim girls get to beat up multiple men.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on. Nobody else is remotely close to their level. I would gladly watch this again immediately. Booking the tickets right now.","i have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!after the fantastic underwater opening,

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now. I'll catch MI: Dead Reckoning Part 2 at home on Paramount-plus when it streams at no cost.","the cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. after the credits roll, tom

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.","mission impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. until now.the plot can be summed up in a few words -- ethan hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an ai entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. this leads to some serious pacing issues.one of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which ethan and the newest imf member grace (hayley atwell) careen about in a yellow fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. roger moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in for your eyes only (his silly yellow car being a 2cv), but in dead reckoning, it's just embarrassing.the deactivation of a bomb by benji (simon pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. the final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac benji. this entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. i'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash?

"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.","i was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in czech republic as a

"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.","greetings again from the darkness. the challenge

"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.","to me, a new m:i film is an event. from part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).there's some good stuff

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.","'mission: impossible - dead reckoning part i (m:i7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with ethan (cruise)

"Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.","am huge fan of mi franchise. the best part about all mi movies were

"A Part One that still felt like a complete movie, this is how you make a great movie in a franchise that's already going for almost 30 years and they still nailed it and keeps getting better or still as great, when you handing it on the right person like Tom Cruise who are giving his 100%, and makes a really careful good decision then it will work, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One was another achievement in action movies as a whole, this is the most serious MI movie experience i've ever experienced and one of the most serious movie experience i've ever experienced as i really locked in and really engaged to the story, following every single dialogue that are really well written, and man do we have to talk about the performance, Tom Cruise, Ving Rhames, and Simon Pegg was like a family already and i'm pretty sure they did not need any rehearsal as they chemistry was already there since the fifth one, Rebecca Ferguson and Vanessa Kirby returning performance was also great, Pom Klementieff gave a very interesting performance as a character and she was amazing in terms of action sequences, Esai Morales was a good intense villain, and last but not least Hayley Atwell at possibly her best performance she's ever in and i think she might be my favorite Ethan Hunt sort of sidekick besides his own team, she was incredible and her present was lovely every single second of it, action scene in MI movie was always in another different level, top notch craziness and just all full praises for the action sequence, they did borrowed some things but i didn't take it as a problem, one of the last sequence in the movie involving only Tom Cruise and Hayley Atwell was one of the most intense sequence i've ever seen and it was just perfect, now it's important for me to also say that the movie wasn't completely perfect as there is some couple of little poor editing in the first 15 minutes and couple of nit picky here and there but not up to the point where it's losing a big 1 score from 10 to 9, so overall Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One was another solid installment from a solid franchise, a 2 hours and 43 minutes movie that goes fly just like that because the movie was fills with great story, great performance, great action, great score, great writing, and great everything, i have a blast with Dead Reckoning Part One, and thank you Tom Cruise for making a movie that obviously made from the heart because this movie is amazing and just incredibly well made, well done Sir!","a part one that still felt like a complete movie, this is how

"I'll admit that some of the Mission: Impossible movies blur together (though I like them all, to varying degrees), so I have to cautiously say that Dead Reckoning Part One might be the best so far. I've only seen the others once each, and didn't rewatch any in preparation for this one, but I don't remember any of the others being quite this entertaining or amazingly well-paced.After the slog that was Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Dead Reckoning was a huge relief - a big-budget sequel in a long-running series that actually lived up to the anticipation. This film has an amazing final act- the whole last hour is just perfect, as far as action movies go, being similarly thrilling to the go-for-broke final act in the most recent John Wick.Tom Cruise is great in the action scenes of course, but he's also doing great work here in dramatic and comedic capacities, too. The rest of the cast are also all really good, and even if the most exciting part of the movie is the whole extended final sequence, the action before then is still fantastic (and includes one of the best car chases of the past few years, too).It's over-the-top action that also feels believable and authentic, and I think they just got the balance perfectly right here between hilariously ridiculous and genuinely intense/suspenseful. There's a lot of set-up near the start that felt a bit wordy - lots of silly technical jargon - but I guess they had to establish a central conflict to play out over two movies, so the extended opening was probably needed. But once it really gets going, Dead Reckoning Part One delivers some of the best blockbuster action since Max Max: Fury Road (yeah, it's almost that good).","i'll admit that some of the mission:

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that. I don't care about runtimes but you have to have me sucked in and the whole time, I felt the time...People will love this movie but M:I may have fizzled out with me a bit after this one.","straight up

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know. Especially from people, presumably, who have consumed previous instalments that are demonstrably better in every single respect. Baffling.","reading good reviews of this feels like i'm being gaslit. stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. it is so bad

"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless. If it wasn't for a couple of action scenes I would not remember a single thing about this movie in a couple of days.","all of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining,

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch to the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.","there are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.the mission impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when j. j. abrams stepped in to make m:i:3. he saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable m:i team was killed off in the first act. now, no more double-crossing within the crew. he also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. abrams went on to make similar improvements to the star trek and star wars franchises. since then m:i has taken off. now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. mission impossible is a product of the original james bond era of the 1960s. many tv shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. so it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the american equivalent of the british bond franchise.however, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. how many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains?

and michelle yeoh on a motorcycle they drive down a large number of stairs something seen previously in other chase scenes there is a scene where hayley atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles this was famously done by linda hamilton in terminator 2 im not sure but cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in goldeneyeanother gag that gets old is the face mask how does a mask change the shape and size of your body of the square or roundness of the face in this movie one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds but what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamlessthen here it comes there is the long running time this is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another there is the mi group chasing after the maguffin there is the cia group chasing after cruise there is the paris a woman not the city gang also chasing after cruise chasing after the maguffin also following the followers is a character called the white widow then there is atwell who sometimes goes rogue then there is rebecca ferguson since she made such a great improvement to the cast they even resurrect henry czerny as kittridge who also is in on the chase why so many characters why deliberately stretch to the running time to almost 3 hours do they really think thats what audiences want believe it or not there is such a thing as an action scene being too long the cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well what really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters and it is literally character a has to meet character b at such and such a place at a certain time things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters motivationsultimately it is hard to dislike cruise i will recommend this film because it delivers the goods but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes even if they are well done 6 out of 10,there are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this reviewthe mission impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when j j abrams stepped in to make mi3 he saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable mi team was killed off in the first act now no more doublecrossing within the crew he also added a slight tone of humour demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience abrams went on to make similar improvements to the star trek and star wars franchises since then mi has taken off now the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action mission impossible is a product of the original james bond era of the 1960s many tv shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre so it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the american equivalent of the british bond franchisehowever it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces how many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains including indiana jones 5 released right before

"Tom Cruise amazing as usual. The action scenes are top notch. The third act feels like MI standards. That being said...What a disappointment after MI: Fallout, this just feels like a step back. I cant even say ""lazy writing"", its just too simple, unoriginal and almost old fashioned. ""The entity"" is a bunch of noise lines in a screen, REALLY? Grace is an annoying but beautiful princess in distress, REALLY? Gabriel is an old T-1000 that feels cringe in his every moves, REALLY? The weird blonde bounty hunter changes all her life motivations because Ethan doesnt kill her, REALLY? I mean this are just some examples, its bad.I really hope the second part steps up because we wont have Tom a cruise forever.","tom cruise amazing as usual. the action scenes are top notch. the third act feels like mi standards. that being said...what a disappointment after mi: fallout, this just feels like a step back. i cant even say ""lazy writing"", its just too simple, unoriginal and almost old fashioned.
